voice,Once upon a time... 
voice,...there was a princess grieving over the deaths of her mother and father.
voice,Before this princess appeared a prince traveling upon a white horse.
voice,"His appearance gallant, and his smile gentle, the prince enveloped the princess"
voice,"in the scent of roses, and wiped away her tears."
voice,"""Little one bearing up alone under grief, "
voice,"please lose not thy strength and nobility when thou growest up."""
voice,"""As a token of this day, please retain this."""
voice,"""Pray, shall we meet once more?"" "
voice,"""This ring should guide thee to me."" "
voice,Was the ring from the prince meant as an engagement ring?
voice,"That part was good, "
voice,"but because of the strength of her admiration for the prince,"
voice,the princess made up her mind to become a prince herself!
voice,But is that really good for her?

Wakaba,It's late... 
Wakaba,"Man, how much longer should I have to wait?"
Wakaba,I'm not going to be late the beginning of the new term.
Girl,Wakaba! 
Girl,What are you doing over there? 
Wakaba,Waiting to see my boyfriend! 
Girl,Boyfriend? 
Girl,"Ha ha.. guessed you got dumped, then. "
Girl,"Your ""boyfriend"" left the dorm earlier this morning."
Wakaba,"Why, you... how could you?! "
Title,Ohtori Academy Junior and Senior High School
Woman,Tenjou Utena-san. 
Woman,Do you plan to keep on wearing those strange clothes this semester?
Utena,Strange? 
Woman,Strange. 
Utena,All the boys are dressed like I am. 
Woman,You are a girl! 
Woman,So why do you keep on wearing a boy's uniform?
Utena,There's no rule here that says a girl can't wear a boy's uniform.
Utena,No problem then! 
Utena,"So, in that case... "
Woman,"You little... You're going to keep evading me this semester, too, aren't you..."
Crowd,"Go, Utena-sama!! "
Boy,"Sheesh, skunked again... "
Girl,"Oh, Utena-sama, use my towel, too! "
Utena,"Sure, sure, wait your turn. "
Boy,"Say, Tenjou, if you'd just join our basketball team,"
Boy,the local playoffs would be a sure thing! 
Utena,"Now look! I'm a girl, you know. "
Utena,"I don't like playing basketball with a bunch of stinking, sweaty boys."
Boy,"Why not? You're mighty boyish yourself, Tenjou."
Utena,Don't say such rude things. 
Boy,"Well then, why do you wear that boy's uniform? "
Utena,"That's ""prince."" "
Boy,Huh? 
Utena,"Instead of a princess to be protected, "
Utena,I want to become a dashing prince. 
Boy,What's that mean? 
Utena,That smell... 
Utena,It's the smell of roses. 
Utena,How long have I felt nostalgic over the scent of roses?
Utena,What's going on over there? 
Utena,A lovers' quarrel? 
Utena,At least do that someplace where no one else can see you.
Utena,"Hey, hey... that's going a bit too far. "
Utena,Whew... 
Wakaba,Utena! 
Utena,Wakaba.. you're heavy... 
Wakaba,This is your punishment for leaving me behind this morning. Now say you're sorry!
Utena,"Okay, okay... "
Wakaba,"Oh, Saionji-sama! "
Utena,Saionji? 
Wakaba,You don't know who Saionji-sama is? 
Utena,"Oh, is he famous? "
Utena,I know who the guy in front of him is. 
Utena,"That's got to be Kiryuu Touga, the Student Council President, right?"
Wakaba,"Yep! And the other guy is the Vice-President, Saionji Kyouichi-sama."
Utena,What about her? 
Wakaba,Ahh... that's Himemiya Anthy. 
Utena,Himemiya... Anthy... 
Wakaba,"All she does is take care of the roses, though no one's asked her to. She's so weird."
Wakaba,She'll be in our class from now on. 
Utena,"So, is Saionji going out with that Himemiya girl?"
Wakaba,Not even! Tough old Saionji-sama could never have any feelings for a girl like her.
Wakaba,The only reason they're together is because they're both part of the Student Council.
Utena,"Wakaba... he's sort of your type, isn't he?"
Wakaba,"Oh, I hate it when you get jealous! Don't you worry, I belong only to you."
Wakaba,"After all, you're much, much cooler than any boy!"
Saionji,"This is a sudden meeting, fellow Councilors... "
Miki,"Saionji-san, we are the chosen members of the Rose Signet."
Juri,Don't forget that our one and only rule is to uphold the Code.
Touga,"Saionji, we have a problem with the way you've been treating the Bride recently."
Saionji,"Oh, is that so? "
Touga,"Certainly, she is engaged to you currently. "
Touga,"However, that doesn't mean you can do whatever you please to her."
Miki,"""Whatever he pleases?"" "
Juri,"""Whatever he pleases,"" you say? "
Touga,"Quit abusing the Bride, Saionji. "
Touga,The existence of our Student Council is the behest of the Ends of the World.
Touga,"Should they know of this matter, the Ends of the World will be displeased."
Saionji,Stay out of this. 
Saionji,"Presently, the Bride and I are deeply in love."
Saionji,I don't want to hear complaints from the likes of you.
Miki,"""Deeply in love?"" "
Anthy,"Right now, I am Saionji-sama's Bride. "
Anthy,I will do everything he wishes. 
Saionji,"Well, that's how it is between us. "
Saionji,"If you're so concerned with the Code, "
Saionji,"then win back the Bride in a duel in accordance with the Code, Councilors."
Touga,Don't forget that the next duel will be soon upon-
Saionji,I'm already looking forward to whoever it is that will challenge me.
Wakaba,"Ooh, that's so pretty... that rose pattern. "
Wakaba,"Say, that's our school emblem, isn't it?"
Utena,Sure looks like it. 
Wakaba,Who'd you get it from? 
Utena,A prince on a white horse. 
Utena,"""This ring should guide thee to me."" "
Wakaba,What's that about? 
Utena,"I think someone said that to me when he gave me the ring,"
Utena,"but I was real little then, so I don't remember too well."
Wakaba,I know what you mean. 
Wakaba,"When I was a little girl, my mama said to me,"
Wakaba,"""You're the princess of the Onion Kingdom!"" "
Wakaba,and I actually believed her. 
Utena,"So your head's always been shaped like that, huh?"
Wakaba,I wonder what that's about... 
crowd,Now what's this? 
Utena,What's going on here? 
boy,Someone's love letter got posted here. 
Utena,Love letter? 
boy,"hmmm, let's see... ""so then I was dancing with you in my dreams, Saionji-san."""
boy,"""You were smiling so gently. You must think I'm such an idiot."""
boy,Heh! I'll say! 
Utena,You guys are the idiots! 
Utena,This is such a tasteless thing to do. 
boy,"Hey, if it's up there, anybody would read it."
Utena,Nice guys wouldn't read this- 
Utena,Wakaba... 
Utena,Wakaba! 
Utena,YOU sent that letter to Saionji? 
Utena,That Saionji jerk is not getting away with this...
Saionji,How should I know? 
Saionji,Someone probably picked the letter out of the trash and posted it on their own.
Utena,Why did you throw it away in such a public place?
Saionji,What I do with my letters is my own business.
Saionji,"But, now that I think of it, "
Saionji,"if that sort of stupid, no, silly letter has amused anyone, then all the better."
Saionji,Was that all you wanted to talk about? 
Utena,No. 
Utena,"You're the captain of the Kendo Club, right?"
Utena,You've got a duel with me today after school!
Saionji,What do you... 
Saionji,So that's it. 
Saionji,You're the next challenger. 
Utena,What do you mean by that? 
Saionji,"All right, then. "
Saionji,I'll meet you after classes at the Duel Arena in the forest at the rear of the school.
Utena,Forest? The one that's off-limits? 
A-ko,"I wonder, I wonder... do you know what I wonder?"
B-ko,I hear there's going to be another duel out back in the forest today!
A-ko,"Oh, brave warrior, you're going to fight for your friend, meddlesome brave warrior!"
B-ko,"But beware, brave warrior... "
A-ko,"They fight by a Code, there in the forest. "
B-ko,"Do you know that, I wonder? "
A-ko,"I wonder, I wonder... "
both,Do you know what I wonder? 
Utena,"What the... Now how am I supposed to get into this place, anyway?"
Utena,"And of course, it's locked. "
Utena,Hey! That's cold! 
Utena,What kind of gate is this? 
Utena,"Well, whatever. I'm going in! "

Utena,A castle in midair? How? 
Saionji,"So, this is your first time to see the castle, eh?"
Utena,What is it? I sure couldn't see it from outside the forest.
Saionji,"It's a mirage, of sorts. "
Saionji,"You can think of it as magic, if you like."
Utena,A mirage? 
Saionji,What surprises me is someone outside the Student Council possessing a Rose Signet.
Utena,Rose Signet? 
Saionji,I mean this. 
Utena,That ring... 
Saionji,Anthy! 
Saionji,Prepare us for battle! 
Utena,Himemiya... Anthy... 
Utena,"Himemiya, what are YOU doing here? "
Saionji,"Naturally, the Bride ought to be in attendance."
Utena,Bride? 
Utena,That smell... 
Utena,"It's the same, the same as my prince's roses."
Anthy,The person whose rose gets scattered loses the duel.
Utena,Huh? 
Anthy,Good luck to you. 
Utena,What was that for? 
Saionji,"Don't toy with me, Anthy! "
Saionji,"You're the Rose Bride, in other words, MY flower."
Saionji,How dare you wish anyone else good luck?
Anthy,"I'm sorry, Saionji-sama. "
Utena,"Stupid! He does all this, and you still submit to him?"
Anthy,"Saionji-sama is the current duel champion, so he can do with me as he likes."
Utena,What does that mean? 
Utena,Isn't he supposed to be your boyfriend? 
Saionji,"So, let us begin. "
Utena,"I'm not sure what's going on here, but it doesn't matter, as long as I beat him, right?"
Anthy,"O roses of the noble castle, "
Utena,What? More magic? 
Anthy,"O Power of Dios that slumbers within me,"
Anthy,Harken unto thy master and reveal to us...
