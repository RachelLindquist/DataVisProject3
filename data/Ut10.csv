Juri,That fool... 
Juri,Starting a Duel over his desire for the Rose Bride without permission from the Ends of the World...
Juri,Is there any limit to his shame? 
Miki,"I thought he might do that eventually, "
Miki,"but now that he has, does it really seem true to character?"
Juri,So he turned out to be the laughingstock of the Student Council.
Touga,I'll do everything in my power to have your expulsion overturned as quickly as possible.
Saioinji,Sorry to further burden you... 
Touga,Your's and Himemiya's exchange diary? 
Touga,I see. 
Touga,I'll take responsibility for delivering it to her.
Saionji,Sorry for all the trouble I've caused thus far.
Touga,"Don't worry about it; after all, we are best friends."
Title,Nanami's Precious One 
Touga,"If the egg's shell does not break, the chick will die without being born."
Touga,We are the chick; the egg is the world. 
Touga,"If the world's shell does not break, we will die without being born."
Touga,Break the world's shell! 
All,For the sake of revolutionizing the world! 
Touga,We've received a new letter from the Ends of the World.
Touga,Another Duel will be soon upon us. 
Juri,"Taking turns, Touga should be next, but... "
Miki,Touga-sempai's wound hasn't healed yet. 
Miki,I'll fight in his place. 
Juri,You can't beat Utena. 
Juri,"I'll go. I will crush Tenjou Utena for sure, this time."
Miki,"I'm going. Please back down, Juri-san. "
Juri,What? 
Touga,"Not so hasty, you two. "
Touga,There is yet another Duelist. 
Miki,That's crazy! 
Juri,"Are you telling me that the Ends of the World has deemed someone else,"
Juri,"besides us and Utena, eligible to participate in the Duels?"
Nanami,It's your fault my brother got hurt! Your fault!
Nanami,Why don't you say something? 
Nanami,Why should my brother have to get hurt over someone like you?
Utena,I'm sorry. 
Utena,"If I'd been on my toes, none of this would have ever happened."
Utena,I'm sorry. 
Nanami,Don't give me that! 
Nanami,Your apologies won't heal my brother's wound!
Touga,Nanami! 
Touga,Nanami... 
Nanami,Onii-sama... 
Touga,This wound is nothing to get excited about.
Touga,"Besides, rescuing ladies in distress is a knight's job."
Utena,Mr. President... 
Touga,"As long as you are safe, I'll be satisfied with that."
Nanami,I won't forgive you. 
Nanami,"Never, ever, will I forgive you! "
Touga,It's nothing to worry about. 
Touga,"Nanami is just upset, that's all. "
Touga,She at least knows it's not your fault. 
Utena,"Should have known, a girl can't become a prince..."
Anthy,What's wrong? You seem depressed. 
Utena,I should be depressed. 
Utena,"Mr. President got hurt because he was protecting me, after all."
Anthy,I wonder if everything is all right... 
Utena,That's what I'm worried about. 
Utena,"Guess I should make a proper duty visit, eh?"
Utena,I haven't even thanked him for saving me.
Anthy,"Oh, I know! Any chance that you're hungry? "
Utena,"Thanks, but I don't feel like having shaved ice right now, though..."
Utena,What's that for? 
Anthy,"Hmm, what should I call this little guy? "
Utena,"So, you were talking to... "
Anthy,"Um, Utena-sama... "
Anthy,"Since a lot of them are blooming now, how about some roses?"
Anthy,"You are going to visit him, aren't you? "
Utena,Himemiya... 
Anthy,"After all, no one feels bad about receiving flowers."
Utena,Thanks. 
Boy,"A Happy Birthday, Touga-sama. "
Boy,B Happy Birthday. 
Nanami,Onii-sama.. 
Nanami,Happy Birthday. 
Mama,"Nanami, why do you look like that? "
Nanami,This is for Onii-sama. 
Mama,"Feh, what a dirty looking thing. "
Mama,Get it out of here! 
Nanami,"But, mama... "
Papa,Give it to me. 
Nanami,No! 
Touga,Wait a minute. 
Touga,"Thank you, Nanami. "
Touga,This is the best present I ever got. 
Nanami,Onii-sama was always so nice to me... always shielding me.
Nanami,"Onii-sama's smiling face was all mine, but..."
Nanami,"Don't, Onii-sama. You'll aggravate your wound."
Touga,"I'm all right. If I don't get some exercise, I'll get out of shape."
Nanami,"If you try too hard right now, you'll just get worse."
Nanami,"Please, stop! "
Touga,"Hey, you don't have to go that far... "
Nanami,"Please, stop. "
Nanami,"If something ever happened to you, I'd... "
Touga,Nothing's going to happen to me. 
Touga,Right? 
Nanami,Aren't you... 
Nanami,Aren't you going to kiss me? 
Touga,"Why should I? After all, we're not children anymore."
Touga,You seem surprised. 
Touga,"Well, I'm going to get some sleep. "
Touga,"Good night, Nanami. "
Utena,"Um, Mr. President's not here? "
Girl,It seems he sent word that he'd be absent today.
Utena,I see... 
Girl,"But, I guess you can see him at the party. "
Utena,Party? 
Girl,"Tonight, at the President's house. "
Girl,"I guess he has to show up there, even if he is cutting classes."
Girl,"Happy Birthday, Touga-sama. "
Girl,This is from both of us. 
Utena,"Oh, she meant a birthday party. "
Anthy,Didn't you know? 
Utena,You did? 
Anthy,Yes. 
Juri,"You can tell me already, can't you? "
Juri,Who's the next Duelist going to be? 
Touga,"Hey, hey... "
Touga,"This is my birthday party, you know. "
Touga,Why ruin such an enjoyable time with talk of the Ends of the World?
Juri,The Duel is set for tomorrow night. 
Touga,Relax. The stage is already set. 
Touga,"Hello, I'm so glad you came. "
Touga,What's that? 
Utena,"Don't get me wrong, okay? "
Utena,"This is just a ""get well"" visit. "
Utena,Since I haven't thanked you for saving me yet...
Utena,What's so funny? 
Touga,"No, I'm sorry. I was just thinking that it's so like you, making an excuse like that."
Utena,"You're making fun of me, aren't you? "
Touga,"No, I'm glad to have you here. "
Utena,What's that supposed to mean? 
Nanami,What a shameful girl... 
Nanami,Are you trying to seduce my brother with these?
Touga,"Nanami, stop it already. "
Nanami,"You stop it, Onii-sama. "
Nanami,She's the one who hurt you. 
Utena,"Hey, that's not true! "
Anthy,Please don't be so hard on Utena-sama. 
Anthy,That was all Saionji-sempai's... 
Nanami,Silence! 
Nanami,"You're the cause of it, anyway! "
Utena,Stop that! What's with you? 
Nanami,I'll never let you have him. 
Nanami,I'll never let the likes of you have my brother!
Boy,Is that what's going on? 
Boy,"Touga and Utena, huh? "
Boy,"Well, there's a surprise. "
Utena,"No, there's nothing really between us... "
Touga,"I suppose it's my fault, for spoiling her."
Touga,"Despite all I say, "
Touga,Nanami is still her brother's girl. 
Utena,"Because you're the ""World's Greatest Brother,"" of course any other boy would be worthless."
Touga,Did Miki say that? 
Utena,Maybe. 
Touga,He talks too much. 
Touga,It must have been at one of my birthday parties.
Touga,"Nanami didn't have a present for me, so she went and found a kitten."
Utena,A kitten? 
Touga,"Even though the kitten disappeared soon after, that was the present that made me happiest."
Anthy,Um... 
Anthy,I just missed my chance to give you mine just now.
Touga,"Hey, stop that, you... "
Anthy,You don't like cats? 
Touga,"Oh, no, I do, and thank you, it's a wonderful present."
Touga,Get out of here! 
Nanami,"Onii-sama, come help me pick some apples. "
Touga,"OK, later. "
Nanami,"But I can't reach them. Come on, Onii-sama... "
Touga,"Leave me alone, I'm playing with this kitten here."
Nanami,Bad kitty! 
Touga,"Quit that! He's just playing around, you know."
Nanami,But... 
Touga,Get out of here! 
Nanami,"It's your own fault, for coming between me and my brother."
Nanami,Onii-sama belongs only to me! 
Miki,"Stop that, Nanami-kun. "
Miki,Do you even know what you're doing? 
Nanami,"Don't even think of trying to escape me, Tenjou-san."
Juri,"If you make a fuss, you'll be expelled just like Saionji."
Nanami,I don't care. 
Touga,The Academy has its rules. 
Touga,"Nanami, give me your left hand. "
Nanami,Onii-sama... 
Touga,"Have you forgotten, Nanami? "
Touga,The Rose Signet is the only piece of authentication that allows you fight Duels here at the Academy.
Touga,"Now show me your power, as a chosen one of the ""Ends of the World."""
Miki,"You mean, Nanami-kun is also a Duelist? "
Touga,"Tomorrow night, at the Arena, you will fight this next Duel."
A-ko,"Look, look, I've found a kitten. "
A-ko,I wonder what I should name it. 
B-ko,"How about ""Jewel?"" "
A-ko,That's too ordinary. Aren't there any more unusual names?
B-ko,"""Unusual Jewel"" "
A-ko,"Umm, no, not quite. Isn't there a name which is more tasteful?"
B-ko,"""Tasteful Unusual Jewel"" "
A-ko,"No, that's not it... "
A-ko,"Isn't there some name that's cute-sounding, dignified, and easy to remember?"
B-ko,"""Cute-sounding Dignified Easy to Remember Tasteful Unusual Jewel"""
A-ko,"Oh, all right, already! "
A-ko,"If ""Jewel"" is really that good, than ""Jewel"" it is."
B-ko,"Come here, Juliano. "
A-ko,"Hey, I said enough with the cute names! "
