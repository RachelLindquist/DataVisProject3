OP,Revolution!

Utena,It feels so good to have lunch outdoors for a change.
Wakaba,You bet! You bet! 
Wakaba,"I'm so smart to suggest it, aren't I? "
Wakaba,Here here here... 
Wakaba,"See, I made some for you too. "
Utena,But I... 
Wakaba,"No way. Such a tasteless lunch would be boring, right?"
Wakaba,"Instead of that, have some of this lunch full of my love for Utena-sama!"
Wakaba,Look... Look! LOOK! 
Utena,Yeah... 
Wakaba,I'm so glad! 
Utena,Cut it out already! 
Title,Graceful and Ruthless; The One Who Picks the Flower
Wakaba,"Now, don't be too surprised! Tah-dah! "
Wakaba,"Basically these are prepackaged food, but the forms look super-pretty, don't they?"
Utena,"Well, love or not, there's no doubt they look delicious."
Utena,"Thanks, Wakaba. "
Wakaba,All right! 
Wakaba,Now that makes my cooking effort pay off!
Wakaba,"That's just like you, Wakaba-chan! Well done!"
Anthy,Utena-sama... 
Anthy,"Would you take a look at my lunch, too? "
Utena,If it isn't shaved ice again... 
Anthy,Here. 
Utena,"Wow, that's quite a lot. "
Wakaba,Impressive... 
Anthy,"Please, have some. "
Utena,The first layer is... 
Wakaba,Takoyaki... aren't they? 
Anthy,Yes. 
Utena,And the second layer... 
Wakaba,"Yakisoba... okay, okay... "
Anthy,"It looks delicious, doesn't it? "
Utena,The third layer is... 
Anthy,"Oh, my! "
Utena,"Well, what do you know! Pretty normal, although it's like food from a temple festival or something."
Wakaba,"""Pretty normal?"" What kind of lunch were you expecting?"
Utena,"Uh, let's talk about it after we eat. "
Miki,What do you see? 
Touga,"Oh, it's you. "
Touga,I see a lonely princess. 
Miki,"Tenjou-sempai, and Himemiya-san, too. Looks like they're enjoying themselves."
Miki,"But by a lonely princess, you mean...? "
Touga,You can't see her. 
Touga,No one can see her but me. 
Miki,You mean it's an illusion? 
Touga,"Oh, she really exists. "
Touga,She's visible and tangible. 
Wakaba,Bravo! Bravo! 
Wakaba,"What're you looking at, Utena? "
Utena,"Oh, nothing. "
Wakaba,"A-ha, it's the Prince of the Student Council."
Utena,"""Prince?"" "
Utena,"That time, he definitely said... "
Touga,"""Wasn't your prince someone like me?"" "
Utena,"If that's true, then is Mr. President my prince from back then?"
Anthy,Bravo! Bravo! 
Wakaba,"Are you alright, eating like that? "
Touga,"If the egg's shell does not break, the chick will die without being born."
Touga,We are the chick; the egg is the world. 
Touga,"If the world's shell does not break, we will die without being born."
Touga,Break the world's shell! 
"Touga,Juri",For the sake of revolutionizing the world!
Touga,"As you may already know, "
Touga,Nanami lost the Duel to Tenjou Utena. 
Touga,"I'm ashamed to say, the difference in their abilities was made clear."
Juri,As it was from the start. 
Juri,Nanami-kun fought only to lose... 
Juri,"...just as Student Council President Kiryuu Touga had planned, right?"
Touga,It's regrettable that you see it that way.
Touga,Since I always try to treat Nanami with affection...
Miki,Like a pet cat? 
Miki,6.12 seconds... 
Touga,It was her own fault that Nanami lost the Duel.
Touga,"Whether it was someone's plot or not, "
Touga,joining into it was her own responsibility. 
Juri,How cold. 
Touga,There can be times when the depths of one's feelings can lead them astray.
Touga,"The greater those feelings, the further they are led."
Touga,"""Wasn't your prince someone like me?"" "
Touga,Well and truly beautiful... 
Touga,And this breed is said to be very difficult. 
Anthy,Thank you very much. 
Touga,"By the way, you all were having lunch outside today, weren't you?"
Anthy,"Yes. You saw, didn't you? "
Anthy,"With Utena-sama, Wakaba-san, and Chuchu. "
Anthy,It was a lot of fun. 
Touga,That's excellent. 
Anthy,Wakaba-san's lunch was so delicious. 
Anthy,I want to make a dish like that. 
Touga,"The Rose Bride, cooking? "
Touga,You shouldn't do such things as cooking. 
Touga,You should only take care of the roses here.
Touga,This birdcage is your territory. 
Touga,And you are the beautiful little bird which lives here.
Touga,"I want to possess this birdcage, and everything in it."
Touga,"I would never take you out from here, ever..."
Touga,Forever... 
Utena,Stay away from Himemiya! 
Touga,"Hi, I'm glad you've come. "
Utena,"You don't see Himemiya as anything but the Rose Bride either, do you?"
Touga,Is that wrong? 
Utena,It is wrong! 
Utena,"Cut it out with that ""Rose Bride"" or ""possession"" nonsense."
Utena,That girl is an ordinary girl named Himemiya Anthy!
Touga,Is she? 
Touga,Is it true that you're an ordinary girl? 
Utena,"You don't like it, do you? "
Utena,Being the Rose Bride or whatever... 
Anthy,I... 
Utena,"Go ahead, speak your mind! "
Anthy,My mind... 
Utena,Yeah! 
Utena,"You hate being treated as the Rose Bride, right?"
Utena,Tell him clearly! 
Anthy,All right. 
Anthy,I hate being treated as the Rose Bride. 
Utena,What's so funny? 
Touga,Nothing. Pardon me. 
Touga,"This girl is certainly your bride, isn't she?"
Touga,Here. 
Utena,What do you want with Himemiya? 
Touga,"With her, nothing. "
Touga,I thought I could get to see you here. 
Touga,I was waiting for you. 
Utena,What do you want with me? 
Touga,"As your prince, I have something important to tell you."
Utena,Prince? 
Utena,Then... 
Utena,Then Mr. President is my prince after all...?
Touga,You were crying then... 
Touga,...shedding so many sparkling tears. 
Utena,"Yes, "
Utena,I was crying then. 
Utena,Are you really the one who saved me that time?
Touga,Do you want proof? 
Utena,Proof? 
Touga,"Now, didn't it feel something like this? "
Utena,He's going to kiss me... 
Utena,"But then, it... "
Utena,...felt like this. 
Touga,Excuse me. It was imprudent... 
Touga,"Two Duelists, in front of the Rose Bride... "
Touga,"Well, then... "
Touga,that something important I had to tell you...
Touga,"Tenjou Utena, I challenge you to a Duel. "
Utena,I had... 
Utena,completely forgotten that Kiryuu Touga was a Duelist.
Utena,But... 
Utena,that Prince who saved me when I was little... 
Utena,I came to this school because I wanted to meet him.
Utena,To think that one and only tie is going to make me fight my prince...
Utena,If it weren't for this ring... 
Anthy,"Utena-sama, "
Anthy,the tea is ready. 
Anthy,"Utena-sama, how did you like my lunch? "
Utena,"Ah, it was delicious. Thanks. Wakaba said it was pretty good, too."
Anthy,I'm glad. 
Anthy,"And Wakaba-san is a fun person, isn't she?"
Utena,"Yeah, she's a good friend who makes me feel happy whenever she's with me."
Utena,"Why don't you become her friend, too, Himemiya?"
Utena,"Oh, yeah, you have Chuchu. "
Utena,"I guess Chuchu's as much fun as ten people for you, then?"
Anthy,I... 
Anthy,"I wish I could become her friend, too. "
Utena,You can! I know you can! 
Utena,"Open your heart and talk to people, and anybody would accept you, I'm sure."
Anthy,Open my heart? 
Utena,Right. You'll be fine. I'll help you. 
Anthy,Yes. 
Utena,"That's right, I've got to protect Himemiya. "
Utena,"If anyone can return her to being a normal girl, it's me."
Utena,I can't let anyone else have her. 
Utena,Not even my own prince. 
A-ko,"Now, my son, stand with this apple on your head!"
B-ko,"Yes, Pop, but... "
B-ko,"Well done, Pop! "
B-ko,But it was the 37919th already. 
B-ko,How long do we have to do this for? 
A-ko,"Until the doctor stops us, I suppose... "
A-ko,"Hold your tongue, my son, and stand with this apple on your head!"
B-ko,"Yes, Pop! "
B-ko,But why wouldn't the lord release us after we succeeded once?
A-ko,Don't make me think! 
B-ko,"Misery! O Misery! What fate is in store for the Tells, as he has become a shooting machine?"
A-ko,"I wonder, I wonder... do you know what I wonder?"
B-ko,"Aim a bit higher, Pop... "
A-ko,Oops.

Utena,Are you sure we must fight? 
Touga,"Well, sorry to cut into your busy schedule, but..."
Touga,"Shall we begin, Tenjou-kun? "
Anthy,"O roses of the noble castle, "
Anthy,"O Power of Dios that slumbers within me,"
Anthy,Harken unto thy master and reveal to us...
Utena,...the power to revolutionize the world! 
Touga,Give no quarter. Underestimating your opponent in a duel could prove fatal.
Touga,"With that in mind, advance! "

Touga,"Shall we go, Anthy? "
Utena,Wait. 
Utena,Don't take Himemiya. 
Utena,Himemiya wants to go back to being a normal girl.
Utena,I can't be separated from her! 
Utena,"I don't want the power to revolutionize the world, but Himemiya needs me!"
Touga,You don't understand anything. 
Utena,It's true! Himemiya told me she wanted friends!
Utena,"Without me, she'll be all alone again! "
Touga,Anthy... 
Anthy,Yes. 
Touga,"You are happy as the Rose Bride, aren't you?"
Anthy,I... 
Anthy,...am happy as the Rose Bride. 
Touga,"You don't want any friends. You like being alone, right?"
Anthy,"Yes, I like being by myself. "
Touga,"Tenjou-kun, this is how it is. "
Touga,Himemiya Anthy is the Bride of the victor of the Duel.
Touga,"While she was engaged to you, the Code required her to obey you."
Utena,You're lying... 
Touga,The Rose Bride answered the wishes of her master.
Touga,To make her an ordinary girl was merely what you wished.
Utena,It's a lie... 
Touga,"Now that you have lost the Duel, the connection between you two is severed."
Touga,"Forget all about her, and about this Duel."
Utena,It's a lie! 
Utena,"It's a lie, right, Himemiya? Tell me the truth!"
Utena,Didn't you tell me that you hated being the Rose Bride...that you wanted to make friends?!
Touga,"Anthy, bid your farewell. "
Anthy,"Take it easy, Tenjou-san. "
