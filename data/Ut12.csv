Utena,I... lost... 
Touga,"Though you pose as a prince, in the end you're just a girl."
Touga,"Whatever you were expecting, your expectations could not be fulfilled."
Touga,"Well, I think this is a good chance for you to return to being a normal girl, don't you?"
Anthy,Take it easy... Tenjou-san 
Teacher,Tenjou-san? Tenjou Utena-san? 
Teacher,Tenjou-san? Tenjou Utena-san? 
Girl,It looks like she's absent today. 
Title,Perhaps for Friendship's Sake 
plate,Tenjou Utena 
Wakaba,Utena... 
Utena,It's open. 
Wakaba,"Hey hey, why are you staying home from school?"
Wakaba,Could it be a cold? 
Wakaba,"Let me see, no, no fever, your tonsils aren't swollen..."
Wakaba,Pulse is normal... My diagnosis is that you're just playing hooky.
Wakaba,"Oh, by the way, where's Himemiya-san? "
Utena,Well... 
Wakaba,Did you have a fight or something? 
Utena,Something like that. 
Wakaba,Hmm... 
Wakaba,"So, what was really wrong today? "
Utena,It's nothing. 
Wakaba,If it's nothing then why were you absent?
Wakaba,Utena? 
Wakaba,"Ah, what is this? It's horrible! "
Utena,"Oh, I just caught it on something. "
Wakaba,Shall I mend it for you? 
Utena,Yeah... 
Utena,"But never mind, I've got another uniform. "
Girl,"Hey, hey, that's Tenjou-sempai, isn't it?"
Girl,"That look suits her, too. "
Girl,I like this look better. 
Wakaba,It's surprisingly popular. 
Utena,Yeah. 
Wakaba,"It looks like you like this uniform, too."
Utena,"Yeah, well, this is normal. "
Utena,I'm going to wear this from now on. 
Wakaba,What? 
Anthy,Good morning. 
Wakaba,Morning. 
Utena,"Morning, Himemiya. "
Anthy,"Good morning, Tenjou-san. "
Utena,I must act normal... normal. 
Wakaba,So you did have a fight! 
Wakaba,"That's not that big a deal. Don't worry about it, it's not like you."
Wakaba,"Hey, wait a minute, Utena! "
Touga,"If the egg's shell does not break, the chick will die without being born."
Touga,We are the chick; the egg is the world. 
Touga,"If the world's shell does not break, we will die without being born."
Touga,Break the world's shell. 
Touga&Juri,For the sake of revolutionizing the world!
Touga,"And so, the Rose Bride and I are engaged. "
Touga,Any questions? 
Miki,None. 
Juri,How did you win? 
Touga,By my own prowess. 
Touga,You don't think so? 
Juri,I wonder about the scenario. 
Touga,"As a prince, I saved this lonely princess, that's all."
Juri,"A prince, huh? "
Touga,A story's last scene always has to be of the prince and the princess.
Juri,This can't be the last scene already. 
Miki,She's right. 
Anthy,Um... 
Anthy,"Um, if we're being a bother, we'll just wait outside."
Touga,There's no need for you to wait outside. 
Touga,I want you to be here. 
Anthy,All right. 
Touga,"Since you are my bride, "
Touga,I want you to always be by my side. 
Wakaba,"If you don't want to say anything, that's okay."
Wakaba,"But even you know that something's strange, don't you?"
Wakaba,And ignoring stuff that way is strange for you!
Wakaba,You're not the usual Utena. 
Wakaba,I'm starting to get angry. 
Wakaba,If you think I'll quit just because you're being silent about it-
Touga,Pardon me. 
Touga,"I'd heard the rumor, but this is really an eye opening transformation."
Touga,That uniform really looks good on you. 
Touga,So how about it? Won't you have dinner with me this Sunday?
Touga,Without the bride... 
Wakaba,H- hey! 
Touga,So it's set? 
Wakaba,"Hey, Utena. You'd better turn him down!"
Touga,Why won't you give me an answer? 
Wakaba,Don't touch her... 
Wakaba,Don't touch my Utena-sama! 
Wakaba,"And you! If you don't like it, then say so!"
Wakaba,"I, I'm sorry... "
Wakaba,"But it's your fault, too, just standing there like that."
Wakaba,"It's because you had a fight or something that Utena's this way, isn't it!"
Wakaba,"That's right, it's your fault- "
Wakaba,What's this? You can respond after all!
Touga,Your friend is very energetic. 
Touga,Let's talk alone next time. 
Utena,Himemiya... 
Utena,Here. 
Anthy,"Thank you, Tenjou-san. "
Utena,"Look... stay out of my business, okay? "
Wakaba,"No way, I won't stop! "
Utena,You... you don't understand anything. 
Wakaba,I do understand! 
Wakaba,I... I'll never give up! 
Touga,"Oh, I see... "
Touga,What are you saying? That's not true. 
Touga,I'm always thinking about you. 
Touga,I've heard that story. 
Touga,"No, I hadn't heard that. Yeah... yeah... "
Touga,"Well, I'm not really doing anything right now."
Touga,It's true. Okay. 
Touga,It can't be helped. I'll be there in a minute.
Touga,"I'm sorry, Anthy. Wait here for a minute. "
Anthy,All right. 
Utena,Wakaba... 
Utena,Look... 
Wakaba,Hold it right there. 
Wakaba,Don't think you can just apologize and that will be the end of it.
Wakaba,"It's the Student Council President, isn't it?"
Wakaba,"It's his fault you're not yourself, isn't it?"
Wakaba,It's the Student Council President's fault. I see that.
Wakaba,Though I don't know what's really going on...
Wakaba,"But in the first place, why are you wearing that uniform?"
Utena,"But, this is normal, isn't it? "
Wakaba,"No, it's not normal! "
Wakaba,"I mean, what's not normal is what's normal for Utena,"
Wakaba,"so this normal is not what's normal for Utena. Oh, this is so complicated!"
Utena,My normal... 
Utena,this normal... 
Wakaba,"You're just going to be silent again, aren't you? This Utena isn't cool."
Wakaba,You're acting like a sissy who's lost his balls!
Wakaba,"I don't know what it was, "
Wakaba,"but if something was taken from you, then take it back!"
Wakaba,Take it back! 
Wakaba,Take it back! 
Wakaba,Take it back! 
Wakaba,Your normal self is much cooler. 
Wakaba,"And besides... besides, that uniform doesn't suit you at all!"
Utena,"I'm sorry, Wakaba. "
Utena,"When I hit you in the cafeteria, it must have hurt."
Utena,I shouldn't have done that. 
Utena,"I know, it's just like you said. "
Utena,"This really isn't my normal self, is it?"
Utena,Now I'm going to take back my normal self.
Touga,You wanted to talk to me alone? 
Touga,"So, will you have dinner with me this Sunday?"
Utena,Right now. 
Touga,You don't want to wait? 
Utena,At the duel forest! 
A-ko,"I wonder, I wonder, do you know what I wonder?"
B-Ko,"To study normally, to get a normal job, "
B-Ko,"to fall in love normally, to get married normally,"
B-Ko,to make a normal family... that kind of normal doesn't concern us.
A-ko,"Up until now, we've done a lot and we're tired."
A-ko&B-Ko,"So then, shall we return to our normal selves?"
A-ko&B-Ko,"I wonder, I wonder, do you know what I wonder?"
Juri,Use this. 
Juri,You'll need it for the decoration of the last scene.
Touga,Why have you decided to challenge me again?
Utena,It's just that there's something that I want to make more important than you.
Touga,I see. 
Touga,So you've recovered yourself? 
Touga,But I don't feel that I will lose to you.
Anthy,"O roses of the noble castle, "
Anthy,"O Power of Dios that slumbers within me,"
Anthy,harken unto thy master and reveal to us...
Touga,...the power to revolutionize the world! 
Touga,"I think you know that this is no ordinary sword,"
Touga,but I wonder if you know this way of using it as well.
Touga,"Rose Bride, cast off your body, and protect this sword!"
Anthy,"Yes, sir. "
Utena,Himemiya... 
Utena,Himemiya... 
Touga,Well? Isn't it beautiful? 
Touga,It's the power of Dios's Rose Bride. 
Touga,"I wonder, can you win against this power?"
Utena,I will! I'll win for sure! 
Touga,"Oh, really? Just try it! "
Anthy,There's no way she can win against Touga-sama.
Anthy,It's such a shame. 
Anthy,"It'll be over very soon, I guess. "
Touga,Do you see the power of this sword? 
Nanibito,No one has anything to tell
Touga,This is the hidden power of the Rose Bride!
Touga,"Without even knowing such things, you posed as her prince."
Nanibito,There is nothing to be told
Nanibito,"Only in the sealed darkness known as yesterday,"
Touga,And you still don't understand. 
Utena,So what about it? 
Nanibito,"Only in the glint of a mere split-second known as now,"
Anthy,There's something strange about Tenjou-san. 
Anthy,She could even die... 
Anthy,Why is she fighting this duel? 
Nanibito,"Only in the darkness waiting for the light known as tomorrow, in the theater."
Utena,"I may not know anything about Himemiya, "
Utena,but right now I want to get back what is normal for me!
Touga,How pathetic. 
Nanibito,I can become anyone 
Anthy,"It's over, Tenjou-san... "
Nanibito,I can become anything 
Anthy,But I've seen this before. I know... 
Anthy,I know I have... 
Nanibito,Only in the sealed darkness known as memory
Anthy,This is... this... 
Anthy,"I know, just as it was back then... "
Nanibito,Only in the glint of a mere split-second of creation
Nanibito,"Only in the darkness waiting for the light known as tomorrow, in the theater."
Touga,Wh- what? 
Nanibito,"Ah, dance! Ancient continental theatre of"
Nanibito,the actors who wore the mask of Time.
Nanibito,"Ah, dance! Admiration of you that come from the"
Nanibito,"Milky Way railroad, three of the Seven Ancient Wonders."
Nanibito,"Like a star, "
Utena,Give me back... what's normal for me. 
Nanibito,"Like a firefly, "
Nanibito,"Shining during birth, we'll shine and disappear."
Nanibito,"Shining during birth, we'll shine and disappear."
Nanibito,"All of us will be born, then disappear."
Nanibito,"Shining during birth, now shine and disappear!"
Nanibito,"Be born and disappear! I, the jewel"
Nanibito,"Shining during birth, I shone then disappeared"
Utena,Himemiya... 
Nanibito,"Born, then disappeared, the star that is me."
Anthy,"I've been waiting for you, Utena-sama. "
Anthy,"I am the Rose Bride, and from today on, I am..."
Nanibito,"The Evening Star, Ego Star"
Utena,"Himemiya, it's okay now. "
Utena,"So, shall we go home? "
Nanibito,"Shine and disappear, Firefly Star!"
