Narrator,Once upon a time...
Narrator,...there was a princess grieving over the deaths of her mother and father.
Narrator,Before this princess appeared a prince traveling upon a white horse.
Narrator,"His appearance gallant, and his smile gentle, the prince enveloped the princess"
Narrator,in the scent of roses and wiped away her tears.
Prince,"""Little one bearing up alone under grief, "
Prince,"please lose not thy strength and nobility when thou growest up."""
Prince,"""As a token of this day, please retain this."""
Princess,"""Pray, shall we meet once more?"" "
Prince,"""This ring should guide thee to me."" "
Narrator,Was the ring from the prince meant as an engagement ring?
Narrator,"That part was good, "
Narrator,"but because of the strength of her admiration for the prince,"
Narrator,the princess made up her mind to become a prince herself!
Narrator,But is that really good for her?

Anthy,"I am the Rose Bride, and from today on, I am your flower."
Akio,As you expected... 
Akio,"she got engaged to the Rose Bride, and began to walk the Duelist's Path."
Akio,"And then, she faced her second trial, the Duel called ""Choice."""
Anthy,It is the Rose Signet. 
Anthy,Anyone who has that ring is entitled to participate in the Duels.
Anthy,"So, since you are the current champion, "
Anthy,"one by one, you will be challenged to Duels by the other bearers of the Rose Signet."
