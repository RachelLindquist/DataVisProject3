Mikage,How is it that this rose... 
Mikage,"can flower here in the bowels of the earth, where the sun never shines?"
Mamiya,Because my black rose is absorbing the darkness.
Mamiya,"Say, Sempai... "
Mamiya,I've heard that Student Council President Kiryuu has been absent from school lately.
Mamiya,It would explain why the academy has been so quiet recently.
Mikage,"Well, that's good. "
Mikage,A proper academy should be a peaceful place for study.
taitoru,The Boys of the Black Rose 
Anthy,"Then, if you'll excuse me. "
Utena,"I'm home, Chuchu! "
Utena,"My class had a party, it being Saturday and all."
Utena,"Your master should have been there, too. "
Utena,She's always so unsociable... 
Utena,"I'm home, Himemiya! "
Utena,"What, she's not here? "
Utena,It's leftovers from the party. 
Utena,"Man, I'm tired. "
Utena,"Come to think of it, I hardly ever see Himemiya on Saturday night."
Utena,"Chuchu, do you know something about that? "
Anthy,"Oh, Utena-sama. "
Utena,Hi. Where have you been? 
Anthy,At school. 
Utena,I see. 
Utena,It seems like you're never around most weekend nights. Is something going on?
Anthy,"Yes, because I've been told that we should meet at least once a week."
Utena,Meet who? 
Anthy,My older brother. 
Utena,Ohh... 
Utena,What?! You have a brother?! 
Utena,Excuse us! 
Utena,"Oops, wrong floor. "
Anthy,"No, this is the place. "
Utena,"So, this is the Trustee Chairman's Office... "
Utena,Looks like a tough place to keep clean. 
Utena,That's huge! Is this your brother? 
Anthy,"No, this is a planetarium projector. "
Utena,Huh? 
Anthy,Utena-sama? 
Utena,Shh... 
Utena,"Bad timing, Himemiya. They're making out."
Utena,Let's split before we get in the way. 
Akio,Pleased to meet you. I'm Ohtori Akio. 
Utena,Pardon me. I'm Tenjou Utena. Pardon me. 
Akio,Not at all. It was good of you to come. 
Akio,I'm glad because this is the first time my sister has introduced a friend of hers to me.
Utena,No way... You're Ohtori Academy's - 
Akio,No. I'm just the Deputy Trustee Chairman. 
Akio,The real Trustee Chairman is Kanae-san's father.
Kanae,"My father is quite taken with Akio-san, "
Kanae,and he intends to let me marry him as soon as I've graduated high school.
Utena,"Well, congratulations. "
Akio,"I keep telling her it's too soon, but... "
Utena,I never knew the Trustee Chairman's Office was like this.
Akio,"In truth, I'm best suited to spending my time watching the sky."
Utena,"You like the stars, then? "
Kanae,So much so that it's almost abnormal. 
Kanae,And it's been rumored that he was adopted into my family just for this equipment.
Kanae,I hear he stayed here again last night. 
Akio,Stars are nice. 
Akio,"Look through the telescope at those familiar stars, and you can see the true faces that no one knows."
Kanae,"Remember me too once in a while, okay? "
Akio,"If I discover a comet, I'll name it after you."
Kanae,"Really, you're such a hopeless guy. "
Akio,"I haven't been here long, but there is one thing I do know..."
Akio,"The students of this academy are all free, have a love of learning,"
Akio,"and above all, do not fight. "
Akio,Right? 
Utena,I hope it always stays that way. 
Kanae,Nothing bad ever happens at Ohtori Academy. 
Anthy,"Well then, if you'll excuse us, Kanae-san... "
Kanae,Say... 
Kanae,"It's okay for you to call me Sis, since I really will be your big sister very soon."
Anthy,All right. 
Professor,"Thank you, Mikage-kun. "
Professor,"Thanks to your paper, our research lab was selected as the consultative body."
Mikage,"That wasn't my paper, but rather yours, Professor."
Professor,"Hey, hurry up with the gift! "
Professor,"My wife went to a spa a few days ago, and she insisted I give you this."
Professor,Hey. 
Professor,Sorry for the runaround... 
Professor,"This might not be enough, but we'd like you to accept it."
Mikage,There's no need to pay me. 
Mikage,"Instead, I may ask you for your help someday soon."
Mikage,I'll be counting on you then. 
Professor,"Of course, we'll cooperate with you in whatever way we can."
Professor,So that was the charismatic high schooler who hosts the Mikage Seminar.
Professor,What an overpowering presence! I was scared stiff.
Professor,"The Mikage Seminar, also known as the Black Rose Society..."
Professor,It's not just a rumor that there's even a career bureaucrat who's a member.
Professor,"As recipients of his favor, we college faculty can't say it's anyone else's business."
Professor,"Genius high schooler, Mikage Souji... "
Mikage,"So tell me, have you thought about our last conversation?"
Miki,Y- Yes... 
Mikage,I could hardly wait. So? 
Miki,"I deeply appreciate your kind offer, "
Miki,"but I'm afraid I'm unworthy of your seminar, Mikage-sempai."
Mikage,I see. 
Mikage,An excellent intellect like yours would have been just the thing I was looking for.
Mikage,"But, if that's your position, okay. "
Mikage,Tell me if you ever change your mind. You won't regret it.
Miki,Thank you very much. See you later. 
Anthy,"Thank you very much, Utena-sama. "
Utena,Huh? What for? 
Anthy,For not telling my brother about my secrets. 
Utena,"Oh, that. "
Anthy,I don't want him to know about anything that might worry him.
Anthy,"Like me being the Rose Bride, or the Duellist's Code..."
Utena,I get it. 
Utena,It's best for us to keep these things secret from your brother.
Utena,"Kanae-san looks to be a nice person, too. It'd be a shame if they got caught up in it."
Utena,"Now, let's go home. "
Miki,"Oh, Tenjou-sempai, Himemiya-san! "
Utena,Micky! 
Anthy,Hello. 
Miki,Don't you have today off? 
Utena,We went to see Himemiya's brother. 
Miki,"I see... the Trustee Chairman, hmm? "
Utena,"How about you, Micky? What are you up to?"
Miki,"Well, I had to do some research in the archives here..."
Utena,"Wow, you even like studying on holidays! "
Utena,I never even knew this place existed. 
Miki,You don't know about Nemuro Memorial Hall? 
Miki,It's a building with quite a history behind it.
Utena,A history? 
Miki,It's said that a hundred boys were buried alive here a long time ago.
Mikage,"Say, Mamiya... it seems that you're eligible to be the Rose Bride."
Mamiya,"Don't you mean ""Groom?"" I am a boy. "
Mikage,"""Bride"" suits you better. "
Mikage,I will definitely make you a real bride. 
Mikage,And then I'll obtain the Power of Dios and make the secret of eternity ours.
Mamiya,"If you say so, Sempai. "
Mikage,It's all right. We've been acknowledged by the Ends of the World.
Mikage,"But to do all that, "
Mikage,"we must defeat Tenjou Utena and obtain Himemiya Anthy,"
Mikage,and then we must kill her. 
Mamiya,Then we'll need a skillful Duelist. 
Kanae,Excuse me. I have an interview appointment today...

Kanae,"I am Ohtori Kanae, from Grade 12, Class A."
Mikage,"Then, please begin. "
Kanae,"As soon as I graduate next spring, I will be getting married."
Kanae,"He is someone that my father, the Trustee Chairman, recommended."
Kanae,"He... He's very gentle, and can be a little childish, but..."
Kanae,"In fact, he's so much more mature than I am, and he watches over me ever so kindly."
Kanae,I would do anything for him. 
Kanae,I believe this from the bottom of my heart.
Kanae,But... But... 
Mikage,Deeper... 
Mikage,Go deeper... 
Kanae,But... 
Kanae,"But, he has a younger sister, "
Kanae,"and no matter how hard I try, I can't bring myself to like her."
Kanae,There was this incident... 
Kanae,"When I gave her my cherished scarf and told her to use it,"
Kanae,"she said ""Thank you,"" and began wiping her glasses with it!"
Kanae,"I was so surprised, and when I told her it wasn't a lens cloth,"
Kanae,she simply stared at me silently and smiled.
Kanae,"The sight of her eyes made my skin crawl, because she looked totally like an alien!"
Kanae,And my father... 
Kanae,I can't help but feel that my father's illness started when that freak came to our house.
Kanae,I'm not sure if I can keep smiling around her any longer.
Kanae,Up until now I've done my best to like her...
Kanae,But I just can't! 
Kanae,No matter how hard I try... 
Kanae,I CAN'T! 
Mikage,I understand. I suppose you have no choice but to revolutionize the world.
Mikage,The way before you has been prepared. 
Kanae,Where am I? 
Mikage,"This is a holy land, "
Mikage,a sacred place where a hundred Duelists are sleeping.
Mikage,This room leads to the ends of the world. 
Mikage,"Student Identification, D-13. "
Mikage,Take a look. 
Mikage,"This Rose Signet... See, it's black. "
Mikage,"When its bearer dies, it changes color like this."
Mikage,But I think black is more beautiful. 
Mamiya,You can't run away now. 
Mamiya,Because you have been chosen... by my Black Rose.
Mamiya,This is your new heart... and your new life.
Mamiya,Here's one of the roses blooming at the ends of the world...
Mamiya,...for you! 
Mikage,A Black Rose Signet... 
Wakaba,Isn't there anything fun to do? 
Utena,"Hey, we had a party last Saturday. "
Wakaba,Not like that... something more exciting! 
Wakaba,Our academy's just too darned peaceful. 
Wakaba,I wish something surprising would happen. 
ka-do,To the one Engaged: I shall wait for you at the Duel Arena this evening.
Cko,Extra! Extra! Extra! 
Cko,"At last, at last, at last! "
Cko,"At last, that which I feared has come to pass!"
Cko,Earlier than for other people. 
Cko,My big sis is advanced for her age. 
Cko,"Okay, say ""Ahh."" "
Cko,Ahhhhhhh!! 
Cko,What should we do about this wisdom tooth? 
Cko,Ahhhhhhh!! 
Cko,"Oh, what should I do? "

Utena,What's this? 
Utena,What the... 
Utena,Who's there!? 
Kanae,I swear by this black rose... 
Kanae,"that I shall win this Duel, "
Kanae,and bring death to the Rose Bride! 
Utena,Kan- Kanae-san... 
Utena,Why? 
Anthy,That is not her normal self. 
Kanae,"This is my true self, "
Kanae,the other me which slumbered within... 
Kanae,"As long as I have this black rose, I don't have to play the false me anymore."
Utena,Because of that black rose? 
Kanae,"Now then, Tenjou Utena, draw your sword! "
Kanae,"Otherwise, the Rose Bride will be mine! "
WIPC,"They can be divine spirits, they can be evil spirits"
WIPC,"Ah, even if Heaven's vapors were brought here..."
WIPC,Secret thoughts can also be virtue! They can also be vice!
Utena,...the power to revolutionize the world! 
WIPC,"Ah, even if Hell's bewitching atmosphere were carried here..."
WIPC,"As long as such suspicious forms do come,"
WIPC,they shall have a dialogue! 
Kanae,How feeble! Put more effort into it! 
Utena,"Kanae-san, you just said... "
Utena,you swore by that black rose that you'd win this Duel and...
WIPC,"On a moonlight night already severely cold,"
Kanae,...and bring death to the Rose Bride! 
WIPC,might a spirit leave its body!
Utena,Fine. I see how it is. 
Utena,"In that case, I won't hold back. "
WIPC,"A mystery beyond the ken of humans,"
Kanae,What? 
WIPC,"and humanity, dwarfed by their Creator,"
WIPC,is made to tremble in fear at the sight!
Mikage,So that's the Duelist Tenjou Utena... 
Mikage,Now I see. 
Mikage,She's good enough for the Ends of the World to stake everything upon her.
Mikage,No makeshift Duelist whose mind is simply frozen would be able to defeat her.
Anthy,"So, Utena-sama... "
Anthy,Utena-sama? 
Anthy,I'm going out now. 
Utena,"Oh yeah, today's the day you see your brother. See you later."
Anthy,"Uh, Himemiya? "
Anthy,How's Kanae-san been since then? 
Anthy,"Well, she's all better now. "
Utena,That's good. 
Utena,And she really doesn't remember anything? 
Anthy,"No, nothing at all before the Duel. "
Utena,"I see. Then, I guess she can't explain what happened to her."
Utena,"In any case, I'm sorry I had to hurt someone who's going to be your sister."
Anthy,Please don't let it trouble you. 
Anthy,"It isn't your fault, Utena-sama. "
Utena,Thanks. Sorry about keeping you. 
Utena,"Oh, and say hi to your brother for me. "
Anthy,Sure. 
Utena,"Hey Chuchu, you're still here. "
Utena,Aren't you going with her? 
Akio,"Come here, Anthy. "
Akio,Were you lonely this week? 
Anthy,"Yes, Onii-sama. "
ED,Missing truth and forever 
ED,Kissing love and true your heart 
ED,Embrace me with your true arms 
ED,The key to open up tomorrow is reality 
ED,I want to keep on destroying lies. 
ED,"Even if we keep on talking, "
ED,you still won't ever see. 
ED,Excuses really suit adults 
ED,who hang on to old stories. 
ED,Because unchosen angels 
ED,have no need for wings. 
ED,"Missing truth and forever, "
ED,"Kissing love and true your heart, "
ED,I will like tomorrow's new me. 
ED,"At least I believe so; I want to believe it,"
ED,so I want to keep lies hating me.
