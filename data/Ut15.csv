Boy,What's wrong? 
Kozue,"It's nothing. So, speaking of Toshiko... "
Kozue,"In the end, it looks like she went to Atsushi's place again, yesterday."
Kozue,"So she shouldn't have been so stubborn about it in the first place, right?"
Kozue,And then... 
Teacher,Micky... 
Teacher,Are you going to your piano lesson? 
Miki,Yes. 
Teacher,I have high expectations for you. Work hard.
Miki,Yes sir. And are you feeling better now? 
Teacher,"I've caused you problems, haven't I? "
Miki,Not at all. 
Teacher,"Actually, speaking of problems, I need to have a talk with you, Micky."
Boy,What's wrong? 
Boy,Hey...

Nanami,"Onii-sama, have you stayed home from school again today?"
Nanami,"At the very least, you could have dinner on time.."
Nanami,Onii-sama... 
Nanami,"It's all right, Onii-sama. "
Nanami,I'll look after the Student Council. 
Mamiya,The Student Council... 
Mamiya,The Student Council members... 
Mamiya,"With their spirits, we might forge a sword powerful enough to defeat Tenjou Utena."
Mamiya,That's what my Black Rose tells me. 
Souji,"However, they have all been defeated in Duels."
Souji,They are weak-hearted people. 
Mamiya,There aren't many people who can fully control their hearts.
Mamiya,I'm sure it's particularly difficult for people of such young age.
Mamiya,It would be far better to let their spirit swords be received by someone else.
Mamiya,"That way, a stronger Duelist can be born."
Souji,I understand. 
Souji,"For the sake of making you the Rose Bride, I'll consider it."
Souji,"However, drawing their spirit swords requires a hand that can capture their hearts."
Girl,Kozue! 
Girl,"Hey, Kozue... You've changed boyfriends again?"
Kozue,I haven't changed boyfriends... I've added one.
Girl,"Oh, the things you say! You lucky girl! "
Kozue,"Work at it yourself, you guys. "
Girl,Then would you introduce us to your brother? 
Kozue,"Okay, but... "
Kozue,...it seems there's a girl he likes these days.
Miki,"Calm down, Miki.... "
Miki,"Himemiya-san, will you play the piano with me tomorrow?"
Miki,Here goes... 
Utena,Hey Micky! 
Miki,I was just passing by. I wasn't being suspicious... um...
Miki,...what am I saying?! 
Utena,Himemiya! Micky's here! 
Miki,It's not like I'm here to visit Himemiya-san in particular!
Miki,I just happened to be passing by... 
Himemiya,Hello. 
Miki,Umm... 
Himemiya,Yes...? 
Miki,Umm... 
Miki,"...Chuuchuu is really cute, isn't he? "
Utena,It's not Chuuchuu. It's Chuchu. 
Utena,"If it was Chuuchuu, it would sound too mouse-like."
Himemiya,But I kind of like Chuuchuu as well. 
Miki,"Himemiya-san, you like Chuuchuu too? "
Himemiya,I like it. 
Miki,"I like it, too! "
Miki,I guess we have something in common! 
Miki,"Sorry, I'm saying some strange things, aren't I?"
Miki,Umm... 
Himemiya,Yes? 
Utena,Come on! Just a little more. 
Miki,"Himemiya-san, if it's alright with you, "
Miki,would you play the piano with me tomorrow after school?
Miki,I would like to introduce you to my piano teacher.
Miki,"I'm certain that if he listened to you play, he'd be quite impressed."
Miki,So... 
Miki,...please? 
Kozue,You wanted to talk to me? 
Juri,That incident last week with that teacher falling down the stairs was not an accident.
Juri,Rumor has it that he was pushed. 
Juri,"According to him, he wasn't certain whether or not it was an accident."
Juri,"However, just last night, he got a phone call saying that next time, it wouldn't be just a slight accident."
Kozue,"How brilliant, Arisugawa-sempai. You seem to know everything."
Juri,There are things I don't know. 
Juri,For example: why you hate this guy so. 
Kozue,Because he's always... 
Juri,Always... 
Kozue,I will never forgive anyone who disgraces Miki.
Miki,I made some milkshakes. Want one? 
Kozue,Why would I drink something so sweet? 
Utena,"So, you're Kozue-chan. "
Utena,I've heard about you from Miki. 
Utena,You really are twins. 
Utena,"If you dressed up as a guy, I could never tell you apart from Miki."
Kozue,I am nothing at all like Miki. 
Kozue,That girl with the glasses... 
Kozue,...what was her name again? 
Utena,You mean Himemiya Anthy? 
Utena,What about her? 
Nanami,"If the egg's shell does not break, the chick will die without being born."
Nanami,The chamber of freedom and the cage of freedom...
Nanami,"...without showing the vastness of the skies, they cherish the chick."
Nanami,Break the world's cage! 
Nanami&Jur,For the sake of revolutionizing the world!
Namani,What is it? Any complaints? 
Juri,None here. 
Miki,None here. 
Nanami,"From now on, I will act as my brother's proxy."
NoName,I do have the qualifications. Any complaints? 
Juri,None here. 
Miki,None here. 
Juri,Except... 
Nanami,Except...? 
Juri,We don't seem to get letters from the Ends of the World lately.
Akio,Oh? There's a boy who likes Anthy? 
Utena,So you are concerned? 
Akio,"Well, she is my sister. "
Akio,"However, if she is enjoying her school life, then I'm relieved."
Akio,I'm glad that my sister has good friends like you.
Utena,"Akio-san, you really think about your sister a lot, don't you?"
Akio,Do I? 
Utena,"I probably wouldn't understand since I don't have any siblings myself,"
Utena,...but what does it mean for a girl to have an older brother?
Utena,What's this? 
Utena,The moon? 
Akio,"Normally, it's something useless and of little concern."
Akio,"But, every now and then, you look up at it and feel a certain degree of comfort."
Miki,"Himemiya-san, not here yet? "
Miki,I must have arrived a little early. 
Kozue,You saw? 
Kozue,Well? Don't you want to say something? 
Himemiya,Say something? 
Miki,Himemiya-san. 
Himemiya,Sorry. I also went to check the greenhouse. 
Miki,"Oh, please... I'm just happy you came. "
Kozue,I have an interview appointment today. 
Form,Nemuro Memorial Hall Interview Application Form Please answer the following questions.
Form,Name --- Kaoru Kozue Age --- 13 Sex --- Female Address ---
Man,We've been expecting you. Enter. 
Kozue,"I'm Kaoru Kozue, 7th grade, Class B. "
Souji,"Well, please begin. "
Kozue,Miki is my twin brother. 
Kozue,"Since we were very little, he has treated me very fondly."
Kozue,"Lately, even though he pretends there's nothing wrong,"
Kozue,"...if something happens to sully me, he acts outwardly as if everything's okay."
Kozue,"But in his heart, he's hurt and he obsesses over me."
Kozue,That's why I purposely go out with people that I know Miki would hate.
Kozue,However... 
Souji,Deeper. Go deeper. 
Kozue,"But, Miki's attention is gradually going to that other woman."
Kozue,It's going away from me. 
Souji,I understand. 
Souji,I guess you have no choice but to revolutionize the world.
Souji,The way before you has been prepared. 
Miki,Kozue? 
Miki,Kozue... 
Miki,What are you doing? 
Miki,That ring?! 
Kozue,Isn't it nice? It matches yours. 
Kozue,And here is one of the roses that bloom at the ends of the world.
Souji,That is your new power. 
Souji,"So, you should grasp it, without hesitation. "
Utena,What's up? 
Wakaba,It's the finals schedule! 
Wakaba,"No matter how hard you wish... what will come, will come."
Wakaba,"Oh, no! English and Math are on the same day."
Card,To the one Engaged: I shall wait for you at the Duel Arena this evening.
C-Ko,Extra! Extra! Extra! 
C-Ko,We have hot coffee and sandwiches and cold beer available.
C-Ko,We have hot coffee and sandwiches and cold beer available.
C-Ko,"Wait a minute, I'm supposed to be the only one on this car."
C-Ko,We have hot coffee and sandwiches and cold beer available.
C-Ko,Shut up! I don't want anything to drink! 
C-Ko,I don't want anything to eat! 
Utena,Then ignore her. 
B-Ko,"Excuse me, coffee and a sandwich... "

Kozue,...that I shall win this Duel and bring death to the Rose Bride!
Utena,Let me guess... because of that black rose?
Himemiya,Could be. 
Kozue,"Now then, Tenjou Utena, draw your sword! "
Kozue,"Otherwise, the Rose Bride will be mine! "
Utena,That stance... It's the same style as Miki's.

Miki,Yeah. 
Miki,Take it easy and get some sleep. 
Kozue,"Hey, would you make me a milkshake? "
Miki,Sure. 
Utena,"It's there, to be sure, and usually it's something useless and of little concern,"
Utena,"but every now and then you look up to it and feel a certain degree of comfort, hmm?"
Akio,"Come here, Anthy. "
Akio,"Tonight, I'll comfort you, too. "
