Narrator,Once upon a time... 
Narrator,there was a princess grieving over the deaths of her mother and father.
Narrator,Before this princess appeared a prince traveling upon a white horse.
Narrator,"His appearance gallant, and his smile gentle,"
Narrator,"the prince enveloped the princess in the scent of roses, and wiped away her tears."
Prince,"""Little one bearing up alone under grief, "
Prince,"please lose not thy strength and nobility when thou growest up."""
Prince,"""As a token of this day, please retain this."""
Princess,"""Pray, shall we meet once more?"" "
Prince,"""This ring should guide thee to me."" "
Narrator,Was the ring from the prince meant as an engagement ring?
Narrator,"That part was good, but because of the strength of her admiration for the prince,"
Narrator,the princess made up her mind to become a prince herself!
Narrator,But is that really good for her?

Juri,"Oh, Sorya Rich's designer insisted that I must have this."
Miki,"Wow, Sorya Rich is a really famous designer brand, isn't it?"
Juri,I just modeled a little for them. Such a bother...
Miki,"So, do you suppose that necklace is the only one of its kind in the whole world?"
Miki,That's amazing! 
Juri,Nanami. 
Nanami,"Oh hi, Juri-sempai, good evening. "

Nanami,"Now, everyone, the reason we're gathered here today..."
Nanami,"is so that I could unveil this new arrival, the prize of my collection."

Nanami,"The sparkle, the grace... "
Nanami,I'm the only one who fits these elite designer goods. I'm the only one!
Nanami,Morning. 
girl,M- Morning. 
Utena,Pretty weird... 
Miki,I think so... 
Utena,What happened? She bang her head or something? 
Miki,Dunno. 
Utena,"'Cause, first of all, a cowbell is... "
Utena,...isn't it? 
Miki,I think so... 
Utena,"If you know that, why don't you tell her what it really is?"
Miki,You think I could do that now? 
Nanami,'Morning. 
Utena,She seems determined to pick at the scab there.
Miki,More like ripped it off already... 
teacher,"Nanami-san, what's that hanging on your neck?"
Nanami,"Why, it's a cowbell! "
teacher,Cowbell? 
Nanami,"It is nice weather, isn't it? "
teacher,A cowbell is... 
teacher,...isn't it? 
Utena,I guess all we can do is wait for her to figure it out for herself.
girl,"Say, have you seen Nanami-san's cowbell? "
girl,"Yeah, I saw it. "
girl,You know... 
girl,"She's a bit extreme, isn't she? "
girl,Talk about extreme! 
girl,It's something we can expect from only Nanami-san.
girl,Nobody but her can go that far. 
Nanami,Word's getting around... 
Nanami,It looks like everyone is noticing my fashion sense.
Tsuwabuki,"Uh, Nanami-san... "
Tsuwabuki,"Um, doesn't your neck feel heavy? "
Tsuwabuki,"I've been thinking, that cowbell does look weir-"
Nanami,Tsuwabuki... 
Tsuwabuki,"Yes, ma'am? "
Nanami,"What are you saying is strange about this cowbell from Sebastian Dior, purveyor to the Royal Court?"
Nanami,"You can't seem to understand adult fashion sense yet, Tsuwabuki."
Tsuwabuki,Adult fashion sense? 
Utena,It's weird. 
Utena,"It's just weird, that cowbell. "
Utena,"I don't know about that brand name stuff, but cowbells are supposed to go around a cow's ne-"
Nanami,This is why the dyke is so annoying. She doesn't know what fashion is all about.
Utena,What did you say?! Who're you calling a dyke?!
Nanami,I've been meaning to say this for a long time; your school uniform is very weird.
Utena,Don't compare my uniform with that cowbell! 
Nanami,"I wouldn't want to compare it either, with that tasteless uniform."
Utena,What was that? I dare you to say that again!
Nanami,"I'll say it over and over. First of all, your legs are so fat!"
Tsuwabuki,"Oh, brother... "
Nanami,Where am I? 
DonaDona,"One clear afternoon, "
Nanami,Onii-sama... 
DonaDona,"on the road to market, "
Touga,Are you awake? 
Nanami,"So you're well, Onii-sama. You finally left your room."
DonaDona,"the cart rocks gently, "
Touga,"It's all right now, Nanami. "
Touga,It's all right now.

Touga,"Here, Nanami, your breakfast. "
DonaDona,The adorable calf 
Nanami,"What's wrong, Onii-sama? I can't eat this."
DonaDona,"will be sold, "
Touga,"All right, eat as much as you wish, since this is your last meal."
DonaDona,with a mournful look 
Nanami,"""Last,"" you mean...? "
DonaDona,in its eye. 
Touga,"Good bye, Nanami. "
DonaDona,Dona dona dona dona 
Nanami,"Onii-sama, what's wrong, Onii-sama? "

Touga,Let's eat. 
Nanami,A dream? 
girl,"Say, have you seen Nanami-san's cowbell? "
girl,What? She's still wearing it? 
girl,"Should we say she really stands out, or how to put it...?"
girl,"Really, she sure has guts. "
girl,It's more like tenacity than guts. 
girl,"Yeah, yeah, before now, she would never stand in a line behind other people."
girl,"Yeah, right. "
girl,"Maybe she's calmed down some, she seems more composed..."
Tsuwabuki,Nanami-san... 
Tsuwabuki,You're eating again? Didn't you just eat at the cafeteria?
Nanami,"Moo. Be quiet, that's my own business. Moo."
Tsuwabuki,Class is going to start soon. 
Nanami,"I know, allright? Be quiet! Moo. "
Tsuwabuki,Nanami-san! 
Nanami,"Somehow, after I've eaten I'm sleepy already. Moo."
Nanami,"Tsuwabuki, answer the roll call for me."
Tsuwabuki,"Uh, but I'm in elementary school... "
Nanami,Shut up. Moo. 
Tsuwabuki,"If you lie down so soon after you eat, you'll become a cow!"
Nanami,Shut up. Moo. 
Nanami,"Say, look! "
Keiko,"Wow, Nanami-sama, that hair ornament is..."
Nanami,"Well, does it look good? "
Yuuko,"Y- Yes, very... "
Nanami,"Oh, really? Moo. You think so, too? "
Nanami,Moo. I really like it! 
girl,Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight...
Nanami,"Fight, moo! Fight, moo! Fight, moo! Fight..."
teacher,"Hey, Kiryuu! Run faster! "
Nanami,"All right, already! Moo. "
teacher,What's wrong with that girl? It's like she's in slow motion.

Anthy,Tsuwabuki-kun... 
Tsuwabuki,She's in trouble! Nanami-san is... Nanami-san is...
Tsuwabuki,"She called me, and told me to bring her something because she was hungry."
Tsuwabuki,But Nanami-san didn't even touch the stuff I brought and went to the park...
Utena,"Then, you missed her here. Is that the story?"
Tsuwabuki,That's right. 
Utena,But no one's here. 
Tsuwabuki,Strange... 
Nanami,"Moo, honestly, moo, Tsuwabuki, moo... "
Nanami,"He doesn't even know, moo, what I like. Moo."
Nanami,How rude of him. Moo. 
Nanami,Moo.. moo.. moo... 
C-ko,Extra! Extra! Extra! 
C-ko,Chuu chuu! That's easy. We only need to bell the cat.
C-ko,"Chuu chuu! Oh, Nezutarou, how smart you are!"
C-ko,Chuu chuu! But who ever will bell the cat?
C-ko,Chuu chuu! Don't worry about that. The cat has already been belled.
C-ko,"Actually, I secretly put it on him just now."
C-ko,Chuu! Wonderful! 
C-ko,"Nezutarou-san, you're great! "
C-ko,"Master Cat, I went and spread the false information as we agreed."
C-ko,"They all feel so secure that they must be sound asleep tonight, so you can catch and eat as much as youwish."
C-ko,"So, as you promised, please let me pass. "
C-ko,Mr. Cat... Hey... 
C-ko,"Chomp, munch, munch, munch... "
Tsuwabuki,"What goes around, comes around. "
Utena,Exactly. 
Utena,Nanami! 
Utena,Throw that cowbell away! 
Utena,Throw it away! 
Nanami,"Oh, shut up. Moo. "
Utena,Do you know what that bell on your neck is supposed to be for?
Nanami,"Really... It's a Sebastian Dior cowbell, isn't it? Moo."
Utena,A cowbell is supposed to be a bell for a cow's neck.
Nanami,What are you talking about? Moo. 
Utena,Take a good look around you! 
Nanami,"So... so, Sebastian Dior, purveyor to the Royal Court, is..."
Utena,"It's not Sebastian Dior, but Koushi-chan Dior! (koushi = calf)"
Nanami,Ko- Koushi-chan? 
Utena,"You didn't even know what a cowbell is all about, and you were all proud of that humongous bell, wearingit on your neck."
Utena,What you're doing now is what exactly a cow does!
Nanami,Cow? 
Utena,We can't do anything about that now. 
Utena,"What you can do now is throw away that cowbell before you completely turn into a cow, body and soul."
Nanami,Wh- What are you talking about? Moo. How could I possibly become a cow? Moo.
Nanami,"Really now, don't surprise me. Moo. Quit kidding around, already. Moo."
Anthy,"Utena-sama, it's finally finished! "
Utena,What's this? 
Anthy,It's a sweater. 
Utena,"Thanks, but it's a bit out of season, isn't it?"
Nanami,"Moo. If it had gone a little more, moo, I would have attracted intense attention."
Nanami,"Somehow, my mind is getting, moo, fuzzy... "
Nanami,"Could it be a delusion, moo? My appendix, moo?"
Nanami,"Or I might have been bitten by a, moo, virulent poisonous snake..."
Nanami,"Somebody, moo, get me a blanket! "
Utena,Nanami! 
DonaDona,One clear afternoon
