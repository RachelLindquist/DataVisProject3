Wakaba,I've waited to meet you for a very long time.
Wakaba,I was born to meet you. 
Wakaba,"Isn't that right, my prince? "
Utena,You look happy. Did something good happen to you?
Wakaba,"Yep, something good happened! "
Wakaba,Ta-da! 
Wakaba,"Making my dearest, dearest Utena-sama a pretty lunch like this, I'm so happy!"
Utena,"You sure are an ordinary girl, Wakaba. "
Utena,I'm sure you'll make a good bride. 
Wakaba,You bet! You bet! 
Utena,This octopus-shaped wiener is a superb piece of work!
Wakaba,"Yep! ""Aaah..."" "
Utena,Aaah... 
Tatsuya,Uh... 
Tatsuya,"Uhm, nice to meet you. My name is Kazami Tatsuya, of Class D, Grade 8."
Utena,Oh. 
Tatsuya,"Tenjou-san, please read this. "
Letter,Tenjou Utena-sama 
Wakaba,"Kazami Tatsuya of Class D, Grade 8. "
Utena,"Wakaba! Sorry, don't feel bad. "
Tatsuya,No. 
Wakaba,Kazami Tatsuya? 
Utena,"But, to me, stuff like this... "
Wakaba,"Wah, Kazami Tatsuya! "
Tatsuya,Yes? 
Wakaba,"I remember! You're Prince Onion, aren't you?"
Utena,P- Prince Onion? 
Wakaba,"Hey, it's me! I was with you in elementary school. Shinohara Wakaba!"
Tatsuya,"Um, Wakaba? "
Wakaba,It's been a long time! 
Wakaba,"I never knew you were in this academy, too."
Wakaba,I thought this name looked really familiar to me.
Wakaba,"I thought, ""Could it be deja vu?"" But no wonder it looked so familiar."
Title,Song of the Fallen Kingdom 
Utena,"So, what is Prince Onion? "
Wakaba,Why do you look so sulky? 
Utena,I missed my chance to return that letter! 
Wakaba,I'll give it back for you. 
Utena,I can't let you do that. 
Utena,"Proper etiquette, you know. I'll return it."
Wakaba,"It's all right. That guy is no one that you should worry about, Utena."
Wakaba,"But, be careful. He only talks{\i0} nice."
Utena,That's an awful thing to say. 
Wakaba,"He's still what he was. He's always chasing tail, flirting with the girls."
Utena,"Oh, come on. "
Wakaba,That kind of guy lowers the value of men all over the world.
Utena,Now isn't that taking it a bit far? 
Wakaba,He's a cruel man. 
Utena,Wakaba? 
Wakaba,He's a cruel bastard. 
Wakaba,Because... he transferred out without telling me.
Utena,Wakaba... 
Wakaba,"He was once my prince, that guy... "
boys,"Nya nya, onion head! "
Wakaba,"Shut up, pumpkin and white radish! "
Wakaba,I have Prince Onion! 
Tatsuya,Huh? 
Wakaba,I have Prince Onion! 
Tatsuya,Huh? 
Wakaba,I have Prince Onion! 
Tatsuya,Huh? 
Wakaba,I have Prince Onion! 
Tatsuya,Huh? 
Wakaba,"Well, it's an old story, you know. "
Utena,"Prince, huh? "
Wakaba,What is it? 
Utena,"Actually, you feel it's fate or something, don't you?"
Wakaba,That's not it. 
girl,Wakaba! 
Wakaba,She told me to return this. 
Wakaba,"To begin with, Utena and Tatsuya are not a good match."
Tatsuya,It's 'cause you said something weird. 
Wakaba,What're you talking about? 
Tatsuya,'Cause you told Tenjou-san about weird stuff like Prince Pumpkin or something.
Wakaba,It's Prince Onion. 
Tatsuya,It doesn't matter whichever it is. 
Wakaba,It does matter! 
Wakaba,It does matter. It's important to me. 
Wakaba,"It might be something you don't care about, Tatsuya,"
Wakaba,"...but to me, it's a precious memory, so..."
Tatsuya,"Anyway, can you introduce me to her once more?"
Wakaba,All right. 
Wakaba,"If you insist, I'll introduce you, "
Wakaba,...but that's all. 
Nanami,"Micky, could I ask you to play the piano again at tomorrow's party?"
Miki,Sure. 
Juri,"Speaking of which, "
Juri,"...aren't you always playing the piano with just one person in mind, Miki?"
Miki,"Juri-san, please don't tease me. "
Nanami,"Humph, honestly... "
Nanami,Stop playing while thinking about her{\i0} already.
Miki,"It must be nice to be you, Nanami-san. "
Miki,You can satisfy your desire with a grade schooler.
Nanami,"Shut up! That's just play, P-L-A-Y. "
Nanami,My feelings of true love are for only one man.
Nanami,"Therefore, the form of love is eternal. "
Nanami,Onii-sama... 
Miki,"You mean all but your brother are worthless, don't you?"
Juri,"So there's only one feeling of true love, hmm?"
Juri,"If you could easily switch whom you love, you two would be able to feel more relief."
Juri,I guess that goes for me too. 
Utena,I'm still wondering if he is the prince that Wakaba said she can't get her mind off.
Akio,What're we talking about? 
Utena,"Well, my friend happened to reunite with her childhood friend."
Utena,"See, they're not being honest about it, "
Utena,...and I'm wondering if the prince she's waiting for isn't really him.
Akio,That's a lovely story. 
Utena,"Oh, I'm sorry, I'm always the one to talk here."
Akio,I don't mind. 
Akio,"But, Tenjou-san... "
Akio,The inside of a person's heart is like something veiled in silk. Ahh...
Akio,"It seems like you could see through, but in fact you can't."
Akio,The prince people hold inside their heart... 
Akio,...is surely something that others wouldn't understand.
Akio,"But, I envy young people who are in love. "
Akio,"I hope you, too, will find your own prince soon, Anthy."
Anthy,"Yes, Onii-sama. "
Wakaba,"Get it, Utena? You just need to have some tea and make do somehow."
Utena,Somehow...? 
Wakaba,Yep. 
Utena,Have some tea and make do? 
Wakaba,Yep. 
Utena,"I got it. I'll do it for a certain someone's sake, too."
Wakaba,What's that supposed to mean? 
Tatsuya,Hello! Sorry I'm late. 
Wakaba,You're late! How long were you going to make us wait?
Tatsuya,"Sorry, sorry. "
Tatsuya,"Uhm, who's this? "
Utena,"Oh, I'll introduce you. This is Himemiya Anthy, my roommate."
Tatsuya,"Hello, nice to meet you. I'm Kazami Tatsuya."
Anthy,"Hello, I'm Himemiya. "
Anthy,And this is Chuchu. 
Tatsuya,"Hello, I'm Kazami Tatsuya. Pleased to meet you, Chuchu."
Wakaba,What's the use of making eyes at a monkey? 
Tatsuya,What's that supposed to mean? 
Wakaba,That part of you hasn't changed one bit.
Tatsuya,Stop talking like that in front of everyone.
Wakaba,"But it's true, isn't it? You're always cozying up to girls."
Tatsuya,That wasn't what I... 
Tatsuya,"What about you, Wakaba? Why are you accusing me like that? It's strange."
Wakaba,I... 
Wakaba,"Never mind, it's nothing. "
Tatsuya,What is it? 
Wakaba,It's nothing. 
Tatsuya,"If you want to say something, then say it!"
Wakaba,"I'm telling you, it's nothing! "
Wakaba,"Come on, you have something to say to Utena, don't you?"
Tatsuya,Yeah. 
Tatsuya,"Say, Tenjou-san, are you seeing someone at the moment?"
Utena,"I'm not dating anyone right now, "
Utena,...but I'm still thinking about the prince that gave me this ring long ago.
Tatsuya,"Prince, huh? That's kind of nice and dreamy."
Utena,"Speaking of which, it seems the princess near you now has a prince she can't stop thinking of."
Utena,"Right, Wakaba? "
Wakaba,"Wh- What are you talking about, Utena? "
Utena,"Prince Onion is nice and dreamy, right? "
Wakaba,No way! 
Wakaba,My prince is... 
Wakaba,My prince is... 
Wakaba,He is... 
Utena,"Why don't you become a little more honest, Wakaba?"
Wakaba,"That's not it{\i0}! Ooh, Utena, you're just picking on me!"
Tatsuya,A- Wakaba! 
Tatsuya,"Um, Tenjou-san? "
Utena,What? 
Tatsuya,"What did you mean when you said ""Wakaba's prince"" just now?"
Utena,"She's pretending to be strong, but she is a girl after all."
Utena,It might be that she can't forget about the prince she met so long ago.
Wakaba,I have Prince Onion on my side! 
Wakaba,"To me, it's a precious memory, so... "
Tatsuya,Tenjou-san... 
Utena,What? 
Tatsuya,"Actually, when I transferred to this academy, I knew Wakaba was here."
Tatsuya,She hasn't changed at all since the days I knew her.
Tatsuya,"You were always right next to her all the time she looked happy, Tenjou-san."
Tatsuya,If I could be with you... 
Utena,"Then you could be with Wakaba, too? "
Utena,"So that's why you sent me a love-letter, isn't it?"
Tatsuya,I'm sorry. That girl's so shy. 
Tatsuya,"I thought she was only calling me Prince Onion to make fun of me,"
Tatsuya,"...but I was wrong, wasn't I? "
Utena,"Well, I don't know any further than that. "
Utena,The prince people hold inside their heart... 
Utena,...is surely something that others wouldn't understand.
Utena,But I think it's worth it to confess. 
Tatsuya,Thank you very much! 
Utena,But did I do the right thing? 
Anthy,About what? 
Utena,About Tatsuya-kun and Wakaba. 
Anthy,"It's alright. Romance is like, what will happen will happen."
Utena,"That's true, but... "
card,"Utena, you meanie!! "
Utena,"Huh? Oh, great... "
C-ko,Extra! Extra! Extra! 
C-ko,"Step right up, step right up! Fresh tires for sale!"
C-ko,"Today, tire shop's sale! "
C-ko,I'll take one. 
C-ko,"But mister, what is a tire shop? "
C-ko,"How good of you to ask, ma'am! "
C-ko,Fish shops... 
C-ko,...sell fish. 
C-ko,Bread shops... 
C-ko,...sell bread. 
C-ko,"And we're a tire shop, so we sell tires. "
C-ko,Telling good tires from bad ones takes quite a bit of experience.
C-ko,You can't easily tell if it tastes good or bad just by looking.
C-ko,"Well, please give me one of those tires. "
C-ko,Thank you! 
C-ko,Have your husband eat something invigorating! 
C-ko,"Oh, come on... tire-shop owner... "
C-ko,"Now, how will I cook this tire up for dinner, I wonder?"
Utena,Is that edible? 
Tatsuya,Wakaba... 
Tatsuya,Do you have a minute? 
Wakaba,Now what? You sound serious. 
Wakaba,What's wrong? 
Tatsuya,"Wakaba, there's someone you like now, isn't there?"
Wakaba,What? 
Tatsuya,"You're in love with your prince now, aren't you?"
Tatsuya,"Look, you should be honest at important times."
Wakaba,I'm always honest. 
Tatsuya,"Prince, huh? "
Wakaba,What? 
Tatsuya,"Well, I was just thinking you might want to know your prince's feelings, too."
Wakaba,My prince's feelings? 
Tatsuya,"But, just as you finally realized your own feelings,"
Tatsuya,"...maybe you have already realized your prince's feelings, too."
Wakaba,Can a childhood friend find even that out?
Tatsuya,Of course. 
Wakaba,You're right. 
Wakaba,You're right. I've finally realized that I really was in love with that prince.
Wakaba,"And maybe, with the grace of God, that prince will turn around and look at me."
Wakaba,Maybe...maybe finally I can become happy too.
Tatsuya,"Well, then, you do know that. "
Tatsuya,You can become happy. 
Wakaba,Tatsuya... 
Tatsuya,Wakaba... 
Wakaba,"But, will you keep this a secret from everyone?"
Tatsuya,"Yeah, if it's going to embarrass you, let's keep it a secret from everyone."
Wakaba,"I still can't believe it, but I finally found happiness, didn't I?"
Tatsuya,Yeah. 
Wakaba,"You, too, find somebody quickly and become happy."
Tatsuya,"Yeah, I'll find somebody quickly, too... Huh?"
Wakaba,"Well, that's it. I've got to go now. I shouldn't make him wait too long."
Tatsuya,Make who? 
Wakaba,"My prince, of course. "
Wakaba,See you! 
Tatsuya,"By ""my prince,"" she means... "
Tatsuya,"Uh, excuse me? Is anyone here? "
hand,INTERVIEW CHAMBER 
Tatsuya,Excuse me? 
Tatsuya,Isn't anyone here? 
Tatsuya,"Uh, I haven't got an appointment, "
Tatsuya,...but would it be okay? 
door,OCCUPIED 
Tatsuya,"Sorry for just barging in here. I'm Kazami Tatsuya, in the 8th grade, Class D."
Mikage,"Then, please begin. "
Tatsuya,"Well, I heard the rumor. "
Tatsuya,That you can have a consultation here when you're in trouble.
Tatsuya,There was a girl I had been watching for a long time.
Tatsuya,She was a princess to me alone. 
Tatsuya,"But, she left me to see another man. "
Tatsuya,I'm sure she is being deceived. 
Tatsuya,"Oh, and she was such an innocent girl... "
Tatsuya,"I'm sure he'll do all sorts of bad things to her, like... or... or even..."
Tatsuya,"But it's okay. No matter how much of her purity she'll lose, she'll come back to me."
Tatsuya,Because of my love for her. 
Tatsuya,"Yes, 'cause in the end, love always wins."
Tatsuya,I would be able to make you happy. I would be able to give away anything for your sake.
Tatsuya,I would... I would... 
Tatsuya,Why can't it be me?! 
Mikage,"You're really a good person, aren't you?"
Mikage,"So, there's no path for you to take here. Go home."
Mikage,This isn't a place for someone like you.
Wakaba,I'm home. 
Saionji,Welcome back.
