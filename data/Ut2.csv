Girl,Utena-sama!
Girl,Good morning! 
Utena,Morning! 
Girl,She's so cool! 
Nameplate,Ohtori Academy Junior/Senior High School
Title,For Whom the Rose Smiles 
Utena,Morning! 
Girl,Morning! 
Boy,Someone's love letter got posted here. 
Boy,"hmm... let's see... ""and in my dreams, I was dancing with you, Saionji-sama."""
Utena,"Morning, Wakaba! "
Utena,"That's a change, you reading a book. "
Utena,"What's it called, huh? "
Wakaba,For a long time... 
Wakaba,"the heroine has a secret crush on someone,"
Wakaba,"but ends up with a broken heart. Luckily, "
Wakaba,the next day another guy appears and they get married.
Wakaba,"When I first read it, I thought, ""No way! This sucks!"""
Wakaba,But now I love it! 
Wakaba,"Yes! I'm yours, Utena! Utena! Utena! Utena-sama! You're all mine!"
Utena,"Uh, listen, Wakaba... "
Utena,"Would you do me a favor and stop saying things like ""I'm yours?"""
Wakaba,How come? 
Anthy,Good morning. 
touga,"If the egg's shell does not break, the chick will die without being born."
touga,We are the chick; the egg is the world. 
touga,"If the world's shell does not break, we will die without being born."
touga,Break the world's shell! 
"touga,juri",For the sake of revolutionizing the world!
Touga,"Have you received your new letters from the Ends of the World, Councilors?"
Juri,"Yes, we have. "
Touga,We have all been meeting and carrying out the letters' instructions.
Touga,"As it says in this one, Saionji was defeated yesterday."
Touga,And the Rose Bride became engaged to the girl who won the duel.
Juri,Is someone outside the Student Council receiving letters from the Ends of the World?
Touga,Who's to say? 
Touga,"However, she WAS wearing the Rose Signet. I saw it with my own eyes."
Juri,Who is this girl? 
Miki,Tenjou Utena. 
Miki,"She's quite well known in junior high. Popular, too."
Touga,And gallant... and cute... 
Juri,This isn't funny. Another participant in the Duels was added without our knowledge.
Juri,If that ever happens again... 
Touga,"And if it does, what then? "
Touga,You'll quit the game? 
Touga,The Ends of the World sends the letters to us unidirectionally.
Touga,Whether or not we obey them is our own decision.
Miki,"With this Rose Signet, the gates to the Duel Arena opened,"
Miki,"and the illusionary castle appeared, just as the letters said."
Juri,I know. 
Juri,I could never quit once I saw that spectacle. 
Touga,True. The Ends of the World writes in the letters ---
Touga,"""The one who wins a series of Duels and becomes engaged to the Rose Bride,"
Touga,"shall eventually reach the castle and receive the power to revolutionize the world."""
Touga,"And so, we must keep fighting. "
Wakaba,"God is so cruel, giving us, best friends, different rooms!"
Utena,"Well, what can you do? It was the Student Council's decision."
Utena,"Anyway, I heard I got a single room. That's about right for my cool lifestyle."
Wakaba,But East Hall has been empty for over ten years.
Wakaba,I bet it'd be pretty tough to clean it all up.
Utena,Ten years?... 
Wakaba,"Well, cleaning it up all by yourself should be about right for your cool lifestyle!"
Wakaba,Anyway... my room is on the third floor of South Hall.
Wakaba,Drop by when you're tired of the haunted house. See ya!
Utena,Haunted house? 
Utena,Hey! This is a pretty cute house! 
Utena,"Damn, Wakaba scared me for nothing. "
Utena,Hello? 
Utena,Tenjou Utena here! 
Utena,Isn't anybody here? 
Utena,Don't tell me I'm supposed to live here all alone...
Utena,"Let's see, the farthest room on the second floor..."
Utena,"Ten years, huh? "
Utena,It might be... 
Utena,Here goes! 
Anthy,"Pardon me, Utena-sama. I'll be finished shortly."
Utena,How come you're here? 
Anthy,We're to be sharing this room together from now on. Pleased to meet you.
Utena,"Pleased to meet you, too... Isn't this supposed to be a single room?"
Nameplate,Tenjou Utena Himemiya Anthy 
Utena,Guess not... 
Utena,Us sharing a room together is a curious coincidence.
Utena,"It's looking mighty clean, there. "
Utena,Sorry to make you do it all by yourself. 
Anthy,"Well, I did most of it last night. "
Utena,But they only announced room assignments a short time ago.
Anthy,Us sharing a room together is no coincidence. 
Anthy,It's because of the Code of the Rose Signet.
Anthy,"I am the Rose Bride, and so, "
Utena,"""Bride?"" "
Anthy,I am to be engaged to the winner of the Duel.
Utena,Is that okay with you? 
Utena,"Let me ask one thing. That mirage castle, "
Utena,"and that magic sword, what in the world are those things?"
Anthy,"They are mysterious, aren't they? "
Utena,"""aren't they?..."" You don't know either? "
Utena,How can you be involved in all that and not know?
Anthy,"Utena-sama, why are you always wearing men's clothes?"
Utena,"'Cause, well... I just like it. "
Anthy,The same for me. 
Anthy,"Does it bother you, having us here? "
Utena,I wouldn't say that exactly... 
Utena,"Huh? Did you say, ""us?"" "
Anthy,Let me introduce you. This is my friend Chuchu.
Utena,Your pet? 
Anthy,My FRIEND. 
Anthy,"Oh, my goodness! "
Utena,Here ya go. 
Utena,"Nice to meet you, Chuchu. I'm Tenjou Utena."
Utena,"Would you be my friend, too? "
Anthy,"This is the first time Chuchu has ever taken a liking to another person, Utena-sama!"
Utena,"Um, look, would you stop calling me ""Utena-sama?"""
Anthy,"But you're the one I am engaged to, Utena-sama."
Utena,There you go again... 
Utena,That Saionji guy was wearing a ring just like mine.
Utena,Do you know what it is? 
Anthy,All the Student Council members have one.
Anthy,It is the Rose Signet. 
Anthy,Anyone who has that ring is entitled to participate in the Duels.
Anthy,"So, since you are the current champion, "
Anthy,"one by one, you will be challenged to Duels by the other bearers of the Rose Signet."
Utena,You've gotta be kidding! 
Utena,No way I'm going to keep fighting those pointless duels!
Saionji,"Oh, it's you, Mr. President."
Touga,"Did I interrupt you, Mr. Vice-President? "
Saionji,"No. At least, you're enrolled in this club."
Touga,"So, is the captain of the Kendo Club going to fight the Junior High kid again?"
Saionji,Of course. The power to revolutionize the world belongs to me.
Saionji,For someone like her to be engaged to the Bride would be a travesty.
Touga,"That can't be helped. No matter what you say, she..."
Touga,"Himemiya Anthy, will become engaged to the Victor of the Duel."
Saionji,NO! She belongs to me! 
Saionji,She wrote explicitly in our exchange diary that she'd obey me forever.
Touga,So... you two kept an exchange diary? 
Utena,"Aw, man... "
Utena,There's really nobody but me and her in this dorm?
Utena,Is this also part of the Rose Signet Code?
Utena,Chuchu! Can you go bring her right away?
Utena,"If she doesn't show soon, I'll have to eat dinner all alone in this big old dining hall."
Saionji,"Why, Anthy!? "
Saionji,Why can't you obey me!? 
Anthy,"I'm sorry, Saionji-sempai. "
Anthy,It's because I'm engaged to Utena-sama now.
Saionji,"But when we were engaged, didn't you swear you'd dedicate yourself entirely to me?"
Anthy,"True, but that's a thing of the past. "
Anthy,My engagement to you is over and done with.
Anthy,Please give up on it. 
Saionji,How shameless! 
Saionji,How shameless you are! 
Utena,You're the shameless one! 
Saionji,"Ah, you again. Well, this is fortuitous. "
Saionji,"In our last Duel, I let my guard down."
Saionji,Why don't we settle once and for all...
Saionji,"just who the Rose Bride will belong to, eh?"
Saionji,"Tomorrow after school, we'll have a rematch at the Duel Arena."
Utena,That's insane. I'm not about to fight a Duel for no reason.
Utena,"Yesterday, I fought for my friend, Wakaba."
Utena,"I don't care about any of this ""Rose Bride"" stuff."
Saionji,"However, I do. "
Saionji,"And if you intend to stay engaged to the Bride as a Duelist,"
Saionji,then you cannot refuse. 
Saionji,Those who disobey the rules of the Student Council will be expelled from the Academy.
Saionji,That's a school regulation. 
Utena,"Fine, then I accept. "
Utena,I'll meet you at the Duel Arena tomorrow after school.
Anthy,I thought you weren't going to accept any Duels...
Utena,"What could I do? If I didn't accept the Duel, I'd be kicked out of the Academy."
Utena,I'll just throw the Duel. 
Utena,"After that, no problem, right? "
Anthy,"Well, whatever you like. "
A-ko,"I wonder, I wonder... do you know what I wonder?"
B-ko,There's going to be another duel out back in the forest today.
A-ko,The time has come to settle things once and for all.
A-ko,I'm done for... 
A-ko,"But it's okay, 'cause I lost on purpose! "
B-ko,"But beware, brave warrior, "
A-ko,do you know how difficult it is... 
B-ko,...to lose on purpose? 
A-ko,"I wonder, I wonder... "
A-ko&B-ko,Do you know what I wonder?

Utena,It's foolish to get hurt when you know you're going to lose on purpose.
