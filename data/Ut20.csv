Girl,"Hey, did you hear the rumor? "
Girl,What rumor would this be? 
Girl,The one about Saionji-sempai? 
Girl,Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeah. 
Card,"Senior High 11th Grade, Class A "
Card,Saionji Kyouichi 
Card,The above named has been punished by expulsion for
Card,flagrantly violating the Academy's rules of conduct.
Card,"Provost, Ohtori Academy "
Card,"Senior High 11th Grade, Class A Saionji Kyouichi"
Card,has been punished by expulsion 
Girl,Oh... 
Girl,Did that really happen? 
Girl,What are you talking about now? 
Girl,So that's it... no wonder I haven't noticed him around this month.
Girl,But why was he expelled? 
Girl,I don't know... 
Girl,"I kinda admired him for a while, though. "
Girl,Huh? What's so good about him? 
Girl,What are you saying? Weren't you the one buying pics of Saionji-sempai?
Girl,Weren't you the one looking to steal a kiss off of him?
Girl,"Oh, stop that already. "
Girl,"Ah, but Saionji-sempai was dreamy... "
Girl,"I wonder how he's doing, wherever he is. "
Girl,You said it. 
Saionji,Hi there. 
Wakaba,I'm home. 
Title,Wakaba Hath Flourished Verdantly 
Wakaba,Did anybody come by? 
Saionji,"No. You're kind of late coming back, aren't you?"
Wakaba,"Oh, sorry. I just stopped to do a bit of shopping."
Wakaba,Here. I thought you could use these. 
Saionji,I'm sorry. 
Saionji,"Even though I promised to leave soon, here I am still dragging my feet."
Wakaba,Would you like some coffee? 
Saionji,"Although I've been expelled, with nowhere to go, no friends, no money..."
Saionji,"...and as miserable as I am at having come back here,"
Saionji,"...you gave me shelter, as brave as Joan of Arc."
Saionji,"However, I can't just stay here indefinitely, presuming on your good will."
Saionji,"So, before I cause you any more inconvenience, I'll be leaving."
Wakaba,"Ah... wait, Saionji-san! "
Wakaba,"Don't worry about that, I'm happy just to be able to help you."
Wakaba,Now let's just make the best of it. I'm sure you'll be back at the Academy soon.
Saionji,Wakaba-kun! 
Wakaba,Drink this; it'll calm you down. 
Saionji,"Thank you, Wakaba-kun! "
Wakaba,"Oh, no! That's... I'm sorry! "
Saionji,Pl- please excuse me. 
Saionji,"In spite of myself, my shameless behavior... "
Wakaba,"Um, your coffee... is going to get cold. "
Saionji,Right... 
Wakaba,"Um, if it's alright with you... "
Wakaba,I... 
Wakaba,that is... 
Girl,Wakaba! 
Girl,"It's me, let me in! "
Wakaba,W- wait a sec! 
Girl,"What's wrong, Wakaba? "
Girl,Are you busy? 
Wakaba,"No, not really. "
Girl,"You're all sweaty, though. "
Wakaba,"Well, I'm not feeling too well. "
Girl,"And was it just my imagination, or did I hear you talking with someone in there?"
Girl,"Something like ""Thank you"" and ""sorry."" What was that?"
Wakaba,"Oh, I was just praying. You know, to God."
Girl,Praying? 
Wakaba,"Hey, I'm a rather spiritual person, you know."
Girl,"Oh, spiritual? "
Wakaba,Even I think it's kind of abnormal. 
Wakaba,Wanna come in? 
Girl,"Can't. I'd rather not, today. "
Wakaba,"Uh, Saionji-san? "
Wakaba,This is my secret. 
Wakaba,Mine and his... 
Wakaba,Our secret. 
Wakaba,Saionji-san... 
Wakaba,"I've always, always admired him. "
Wakaba,But he was always out of reach for someone like me.
Wakaba,"Yes, he's completely out of my league. "
Boy,"""And so I was dancing with you in my dreams, Saionji-san."""
Boy,"""You were smiling so gently. You must think I'm such an idiot."" Heh! I'll say!"
Wakaba,But now... 
Wakaba,But now... 
Utena,"Hey, Wakaba, my game's on now! Come and watch!"
Wakaba,"Sorry! I've got some things to do, good luck though."
Girl,Wakaba! Play some volleyball with us? 
Wakaba,"Sorry, gotta pass on that! "
Girl,"What, again? "
Suzuki,"Oh, Wakaba-san. We're doing some experiments on psychic phenomena and..."
Wakaba,Pass! 
Wakaba,"The new me, is special... "
Wakaba,"Yes, thanks to this secret I carry, I'm special now."
Saionji,Welcome back. 
Saionji,You're kind of late. 
Wakaba,I'm home. 
Sensei,"...therefore, it seems likely that something similar to this will appear on the next test."
Sensei,"Okay, next question... let's see, who will do this one?"
Wakaba,I will! 
Students,Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! 
Sensei,"Well then, Tenjou-san. "
Utena,"Yes, ma'am! "
Letter,"Dear Saionji-san, I left some lunch money for you."
Wakaba,Something the matter? 
Utena,Huh? 
Wakaba,Well? 
Utena,"Um, did something good happen to you recently?"
Wakaba,"Not really, why? "
Utena,"Oh, nothing, it just seems that you're full of life lately."
Utena,And also... 
Wakaba,And what? 
Utena,"Uh, you've gotten really pretty. "
Wakaba,"What? Oh, stop that, Utena! "
Utena,"No, it's true, it's true, I tell you. "
Wakaba,"Sheesh, again and again, nothing but lies."
Utena,"It's true, I tell you... "
Wakaba,"See ya, Utena! "
Akio,Oh? Wakaba-san... 
Utena,Right. She's completely different now. 
Akio,Like the goddess who leaves her name to the stars in the heavens... is that how it is?
Utena,But how did she become so pretty all of a sudden?
Akio,"You don't understand, do you? "
Akio,"You, living out your predestined fate... "
Utena,Huh? 
Akio,There are special people in the world. 
Akio,And they are always noticed. 
Akio,"For example, like yourself... "
Utena,Me? 
Akio,"Attend me. You're not particularly self-conscious, correct?"
Akio,That is the special quality that you carry from birth.
Utena,Oh? 
Akio,Most people are but a single person amongst multitudes.
Akio,"However, given the slightest chance, they will shine with a light that they have never had before."
Wakaba,"Hey, what're you making there? "
Saionji,It's a secret. 
Utena,I've just wanted Wakaba to be happy for a long time.
Wakaba,How much sugar would you like? 
Saionji,Here... 
Akio,"It could even be said, that for many people, their special time lasts but briefly."
Saionji,"It's not finished yet, "
Saionji,"...but for what it's worth, this is my gift to you as my thanks for your sincerity."
Wakaba,"Oh, really now... "
Wakaba,This is... enough for me. 
Wakaaba,Student Council President Kiryuu still hasn't been to school.
Wakaba,"In his place, Nanami-san is Acting Studing Council President."
Wakaba,It looks like Miki-kun is doing his best to assist Nanami-san.
Wakaba,Arisugawa-sempai is the same as usual. 
Wakaba,That's the impression that I get for the Student Council as a whole.
Saionji,"Hmm, I see. By the way... "
Wakaba,Yes! 
Saionji,Um... 
Wakaba,Ask me anything. 
Saionji,Okay. Um... how's Anthy? 
Wakaba,Himemiya-san? 
Saionji,"Uh, I was just asking... "
Wakaba,Saionji-san wants to return to the Academy. 
Wakaba,"When he's finished living with me, he'll probably forget all about me."
Cashier,"That'll be 2,060 yen. "
Saionji,Evening already? 
Mikage,"What an enviable position you're in, Saionji Kyouichi-kun."
Saionji,You... Mikage! 
Mikage,It's been a while... 
Saionji,"When, I mean how'd you get in here? "
Mikage,The Black Rose Society is privy to even the smallest secrets in the Academy.
Mikage,"But all that aside, Saionji-kun... "
Mikage,"Imagine, you who once served as Student Council Vice President,"
Mikage,...now reduced to freeloading with a female student.
Saionji,I don't intend to idle here indefinitely. 
Saionji,"Eventually, I will return to the Academy, nay, even the Student Council."
Mikage,Oh? How? 
Saionji,Well... 
Mikage,"What do you plan to do about your current state, having wasted your time?"
Saionji,Well... 
Mikage,Well what? 
Mikage,"You could do something, had you a bit of our power."
Saionji,What? 
Mikage,We are distressed by the future prospects of the Academy.
Mikage,Your talent is very precious. 
Saionji,"I see, so that's how it is. "
Saionji,What should I do instead? 
Mikage,"Well, you see... "
Mikage,There's one item that I want from you. 
Mikage,"A trifle, really... "
Wakaba,"No matter how much I try to be his friend, no matter how much I think about him,"
Wakaba,...his heart has belonged to that girl from the start.
Wakaba,"That girl, with her face that says she alone is special,"
Wakaba,will steal everything and anything away from me.
Wakaba,I simply can't bring myself to forgive her.
Wakaba,"Whether in love, or my studies, in the end I'm just another face in the crowd."
Wakaba,My world is completely different from that of the special people.
Wakaba,"But... but... If he's there, if he's with me, then I am special."
Wakaba,"Just a little bit longer, and I would have been reborn."
Wakaba,"That, that, that girl... "
Wakaba,That girl... 
Mikage,I understand. 
Mikage,I suppose you have no choice but to revolutionize the world.
Mikage,The way before you has been prepared. 
Mikage,So... 
Saiionji,I didn't think he'd ask me to bring him that thing to grant my wish.
Saionji,"Of course, I knew I couldn't stay in this sort of place forever."
Saionji,Okay! Ready to go! 
Saionji,"Saionji Kyouichi, heading for a new era of glory... moving out!"
Wakaba,Going somewhere? 
Saionji,"Ah, what... "
Saionji,I was wondering who it was. I'm sorry for inconveniencing you all this time.
Saionji,I'm returning to the world I used to know.
Wakaba,Where is that hairclip? 
Saionji,"Oh, something happened, so I can't give it to you anymore."
Saionji,"But, don't worry, I plan to buy you something expensive instead,"
Saionji,"...and I want to mail it to you if I can, so is this address okay?"
Wakaba,Never mind. 
Wakaba,I've got something better now. 
Saionji,That's... 
Utena,"Hey, a sunshower. "
Card,To the one engaged: I shall wait for you at the Duel Arena this evening.
Shadow,Extra! Extra! Extra! 
Shadow,"At last, at last, it's finally raining! "
Shadow,"Whenever it rains on a sunny day, we have to hurry and get married."
Shadow,That's the custom of us fox-girls. 
Shadow,You guys are so lucky. 
Shadow,"You see, we can't get married until it snows on a sunny day."
Shadow,That's the code of us bunny-girls. 
Utena,What's wrong with not getting married? 
Wakaba,I swear by this black rose... 
Anthy,Utena-sama... 
Wakaba,"...to triumph in this duel, "
Anthy,Draw the sword from me. 
Wakaba,...and bring death to the Rose Bride! 
Anthy,The sword! Hurry! 
Utena,"Anthy, I can't. "
Utena,I can't fight her. 
Utena,"To point a sword at my friend, Wakaba... "
Anthy,The sword! Quickly! 
Wakaba,That's right! I'm going to kill her! 
Wakaba,I'll kill the girl who stole Saionji-sama's heart!
Utena,Saionji? 
Utena,Why are you doing this? 
Utena,"You've been so radiant, Wakaba... so why?"
Wakaba,You just don't understand! 
Wakaba,You couldn't possibly understand! 
Anthy,"Quickly, quickly, the sword! "
Wakaba,"Oh, Saionji-sama! "
Utena,Saionji? 
Wakaba,"Student Council Vice President and captain of the Kendo Club, Saionji Kyouichi-sama."
Utena,"Stop, Wakaba! Stop it now!Wakaba! "
Utena,"This Saionji, is he going out with that Himemiya girl?"
Wakaba,As if! There's no way tough old Saionji could ever have feelings for a girl like her.
Wakaba,The only reason they're together is because they're in the Student Council.
Anthy,Utena-sama! 
Wakaba,"You, that girl, the Student Council members... all of you look down on me."
Wakaba,"Without a care in the world, flaunting the power you all were born with!"
Wakaba,"So, you all can so calmly... "
Anthy,Utena-sama! 
Wakaba,...walk all over everyone else! 
Utena,Wakaba... 
Utena,"Certainly, there are a lot of things I don't know,"
Utena,But I do know this for sure: 
Utena,You are my best friend. 
Utena,"Just wait, and I'll save you now. "
DS20,"Oh, the pity! Although the aged man"
DS20,put all his strength 
DS20,"into his skillful sword, "
DS20,How pathetic his skill is in his age...
DS20,"He misses his target, sword swishing through the air,"
DS20,"staggers and falls, oh, that old man."
DS20,"A shrieking sword swish, Troy's castle tower,"
DS20,"and the burning summit was rent asunder, with a thunderclap."
DS20,"Paris was deafened temporarily, ahhh..."
DS20,Witness! 
DS20,"The white-haired old man, "
DS20,"raising it as if to cut, holds his sword up in the sky,"
DS20,and Paris is petrified. 
DS20,"Paris soon regains his hostility,"
DS20,"and brings his blood-stained, dripping blade"
DS20,down upon the aged king! 
Mikage,"I could just dismiss any useless boys, "
Mikage,"...but if Saionji's such a clown, I guess leaving him there would be more fun."
Juri,I suppose that Saionji's just beaming with pride.
Nanami,He's mighty full of himself for someone who had been expelled.
Juri,"I wonder if he plans to return to the Student Council, acting like that."
Nanami,"Honestly, the nerve of him. "
Miki,"Still, I wonder how he got reinstated after being expelled."
Nanami,I heard it was at the recommendation of the Black Rose Society.
Miki,Oh? 
Wakaba,I'm home. 
ED,Missing truth and forever 
ED,Kissing love and true your heart 
ED,Embrace me with your true arms 
ED,The key to open up tomorrow is reality 
ED,I want to keep on destroying lies. 
ED,"Even if we keep on talking, "
ED,you still won't ever see. 
ED,Excuses really suit adults 
ED,who hang on to old stories. 
ED,Because unchosen angels 
ED,have no need for wings. 
ED,"Missing truth and forever, "
ED,"Kissing love and true your heart, "
ED,I will like tomorrow's new me. 
ED,"At least I believe so; I want to believe it,"
ED,so I want to keep lies hating me.
