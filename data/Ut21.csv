Aiko,"You look pretty as always, Nanami-sama. "
Yuuko,"There's no match for you in this academy, Nanami-sama."
Keiko,"We're really happy being allowed to be with you, Nanami-sama."

Yuuko,Hey... 
Yuuko,"You're in the same class as us, right? "
Aiko,"If you like, why don't you join our group? "
Keiko,Let's be friends. 
Touga,"It was a wonderful entrance ceremony, Nanami."
Nanami,Onii-sama! 
Yuuko,Isn't that Kiryuu Touga-sama? 
Aiko,"It is, it's Touga-sama, the Student Council President!"
Keiko,Then this girl is... 
Yuuko,Touga-sama's little sister?! 
Trio,It's so dreamy! 
Trio,"Ah, what a wonderful encounter! "
Aiko,"It's like, meeting Nanami-sama changed my life."
Keiko,We were lucky we were the first ones to talk to Nanami-sama.
Yuuko,We've got to be grateful. Nanami-sama chose us from among so many students.
Aiko,"Yeah, we were selected to serve Nanami-sama. "
Keiko,"That's right, Aiko! "
Aiko,"Keiko, Yuuko! "
Aiko,"From now on, let's work together and give it our best shot!"
Keiko,Right! 
Yuuko,We're all the chosen ones. 
Trio,Let's do it! 
Nanami,I know! A party! 
Nanami,Why didn't I come up with it sooner? 
Nanami,I'll throw a magnificent party to encourage my brother!
Nanami,And it's got to be really magnificent! 
Nanami,"As things are, I won't be particular. "
Nanami,I'll generously invite all the prominent people in the entire academy!
boy,"Oh, Kiryuu-san, you're on day duty, right? "
Nanami,That will definitely cheer up my brother! 
boy,"Wipe the blackboard, would you? "
Keiko,"That's a great idea, Nanami-sama! "
Yuuko,Touga-sama has really been looking gloomy lately.
Aiko,"I'm really touched by your consideration for your brother, Nanami-sama!"
boy,"K- Kiryuu-san, the blackboard... "
Nanami,Would you all help me with it? 
Trio,"Yes, gladly! "
Juri,A party? 
Keiko,Do please attend. 
Juri,When the Student Council is in such crisis? Honestly...
Keiko,Please! 
Keiko,Please! 
Keiko,Please! 
Keiko,Nanami-sama really worries about Touga-sama. 
Keiko,PLEASE!!! 
Keiko,Please! 
Keiko,I'll get to see Touga-sama for the first time in a long while.
Keiko,But I know he won't be looking at a girl like me.
Keiko,"Touga-sama, still I... "
Keiko,Aiko! Yuuko! 
Keiko,"For Touga-sama and Nanami-sama, let's work together and get everything ready!"
Yuuko,"Yeah, but you seem awfully spirited today, Keiko."
Keiko,"Oh, do I? "
Yuuko,"That's a new dress, right? It looks good on you."
Keiko,Really? 
Yuuko,"Really! Really! It looks good on her, right, Aiko?"
Aiko,"Yep, it looks so lovely. "
Keiko,"Thank you, Yuuko, Aiko! "
Nanami,Well? 
Nanami,Have the preparations been made? 
KIU,"Yes, ma'am! "
Keiko,We barely made it. 
Nanami,"Oh, Keiko-san. I have a little favor to ask of you."
Keiko,What is it? 
Nanami,I completely forgot I had some paperwork to finish up for the Student Council tonight.
Nanami,"I'm sorry, Keiko-san, but would you get it done for me?"
Keiko,But the party... 
Nanami,"But everything's ready, isn't it? "
Keiko,Yea... Yes. 
Nanami,"Then, there isn't a problem, is there? "
Nanami,"The paperwork is at the school. So, please go right now."
Keiko,"Um, Nanami-sama? "
Nanami,Is anything wrong? 
Keiko,No. 
Nanami,"Then, please. "
Keiko,"Yes, ma'am. "
Keiko,I... have always... 
Keiko,I have always been watching Touga-sama. 
Keiko,Always... 
Keiko,The only one who can approach the prince is the princess from the wonder world.
Keiko,Touga-sama... He lives in a different world from mine.
Keiko,Right. A girl like me... 
Utena,"Touga looked better than we thought, didn't he?"
Miki,But he still doesn't show himself in the academy.
Utena,"The way the president is, the Student Council must be in trouble."
Nanami,"Oh, are you so worried about my brother... "
Nanami,...that you sneak around and spy on him?
Nanami,How disgusting. 
Utena,Don't be ridiculous! Who did anything like that?!
Keiko,"My, my. Are you playing dumb? "
Yuuko,You were talking about him just now. What nerve!
Utena,I went to the party because I was invited! 
Nanami,"My, I just thought, ""Even a dead tree may add to the beauty of a mountain,"" and you got conceited."
Nanami,What impudent people there are in this world!
Utena,Now look... 
Keiko,Why don't you try to think about your own standing?
Aiko&Yuuko,I'll say! 
Nanami,I can't stand it to even think about a girl like you hanging around my brother.
Nanami,"Right, I won't allow even a single insect to swarm on my brother."
Nanami,"Shall we go, everyone? "
Miki,"I'm sorry, Tenjou-sempai. "
Utena,"Don't apologize, Micky. It happens all the time."
Anthy,"I'm sorry, um... Was I sleeping? Was I?"
Utena,"Chuchu was crying all last night, wasn't he?"
Utena,"You see, the open cluster Pleiades... "
Utena,"...is known as Subaru in Japan, and is even mentioned in Sei Shounagon's ""Pillow Book."""
Anthy,"That's pretty detailed, Utena-sama. "
Utena,"Well, that's just what Akio-san told me. I've been studying from him closely of late."
Anthy,I see. 
Akio,"Wonderful, aren't they? The winter constellations... "
Anthy,Onii-sama... 
Akio,Friendship is beautiful. 
Akio,"Castor and Pollux of the Gemini are known to be very friendly with each other, but..."
Akio,"The way you're watching the stars together, you look even more beautiful than the Gemini."
Utena,"Oh, that can't be... "
Utena,"Well, I'm outta here. "
Anthy,"All right, Utena-sama. "
Akio,"All right, Anthy, you should continue to be friendly with Utena-san."
Akio,Just like Castor and Pollux of the Gemini. 
Anthy,"Yes, Onii-sama. "
Keiko,What should I do? Touga-sama is getting soaked.
Keiko,Lend him my umbrella... 
Keiko,But a girl like me and Touga-sama? 
Keiko,But a chance like this won't come again. 
Keiko,"Excuse me, Touga-sama? "
Keiko,"If it's okay, won't you join me? "
Keiko,The rain is bad for your health. 
Keiko,"Nanami-sama? It's me, Nanami-sama. "
Keiko,"Where are you, Nanami-sama? "
Nanami,"I'm right here, Keiko-san. "
Keiko,Nanami-sama... 
Keiko,You said you wanted to see me? 
Nanami,"Sonoda Keiko-san, you are now dismissed from all clubs,"
Nanami,"the dorm's self-government association, culture circles, and all the other organizations you belong to."
Keiko,"Why is that, Nanami-sama? "
Nanami,Why?! 
Nanami,Don't play dumb! 
Nanami,How careless I was! The real troublesome insect was right under my feet!
Nanami,To think that I didn't notice until today!
Keiko,Nanami-sama... 
Nanami,"I told you, I won't allow even a single insect to swarm on my brother."
Nanami,I'll thoroughly exterminate all troublesome insects like you.
Keiko,"Oh, no... "
Nanami,"Please prepare yourself, Keiko-san. "
Yuuko,Nanami-sama is about to leave. 
Aiko,"We should leave, too. "
Keiko,Yuuko! Aiko! 
Keiko,"Please, you two intercede with Nanami-sama for me!"
Keiko,You're the only ones who can help me! 
Keiko,Please! 
Yuuko,Did you hear something? 
Aiko,Not a thing. 
Keiko,I admired Nanami-sama from the bottom of my heart.
Keiko,"That's what I believed, and I've been serving her."
Keiko,"But actually, that wasn't true. "
Keiko,"I was only with Nanami-sama to get close to Touga-sama, even the littlest bit."
Keiko,"Without that reason, who'd want to be with her?"
Mikage,Deeper... Go deeper. 
Keiko,That selfish... 
Keiko,I'm a single girl! What's wrong with me falling in love with someone?
Keiko,Why do I have to hold back because of her?
Keiko,"Just because she's Touga-sama's sister, she monopolizes his love."
Keiko,Even right before my own eyes! 
Keiko,And that girl has no idea... 
Keiko,...how I felt all this time! 
Keiko,She doesn't even try to understand! 
Mikage,I understand. 
Mikage,I suppose you have no choice but to revolutionize the world.
Mikage,The way before you has been prepared. 
Keiko,Where am I? 
Keiko,Touga-sama... 
Keiko,Look at me. 
Keiko,Touga-sama... 
Keiko,Touga-sama! 
Keiko,"From now on, please look only at me! "

C-ko,"Can't breathe, snip... "
C-ko,"We're gonna die, too! "
C-ko,It's a curse... 
Utena,That's a room deodorant. 
Utena,You're... 
Keiko,I swear by this Black Rose... 
Keiko,...that I shall win this Duel and bring death to the Rose Bride!
Utena,You're... 
Keiko,"With this sword, Touga-sama's sword, I will defeat you."
Utena,Touga's sword? 
Keiko,"For my and Touga-sama's future, I will fight."
Keiko,"Now, draw your sword! "
Utena,...the power to revolutionize the world! 
Utena,Why are you... 
Keiko,You should know well what kind of girl Nanami is.
Keiko,She doesn't even think of a girl like me as a person.
Keiko,"Knowing that, I've been serving her anyway. "
Utena,But I don't understand - why Touga's sword?
Keiko,You don't need to know! 
Keiko,"Can you beat this sword, Tenjou Utena? "
Keiko,"This sword, Touga-sama's sword! "
Keiko,The noblest sword in the world! 
Keiko,"With this sword, I will attain the great power."
Keiko,"And then, I will kill that girl! "
Keiko,I'll kill that Nanami who stands between Touga-sama and me!
Keiko,That's right. The real troublesome insect is Nanami!
Keiko,I see. That girl is a troublesome insect. 
Utena,I don't even know her name. 
Utena,I thought she was Nanami's friend. 
Utena,"It's scary how the roots of one's hatred spread underground, unseen."

Mikage,Another failure. 
Mikage,"But it is interesting, that she called her master an insect."
Keiko,"I'm happy only being with you, Nanami-sama. "
Keiko,"There's no way a girl like me can love Touga-sama, is there?"
Nanami,"You're right. Considering your own standing, it's obvious."
Nanami,"Please continue to be with me forever, Keiko-san."
Keiko,"Yes, certainly. "
Yuuko,"Keiko, we've been friends all along. "
Aiko,"Yes, we are, no matter what happens. "
Utena,I just don't know... 
Anthy,The one with her hair tied and her bangs curled is Keiko-san.
Anthy,The one with shoulder-length hair curling to the outside is Aiko-san.
Anthy,The one with her hair curling to the inside around her cheeks is Yuuko-san.
Utena,That's not what I'm talking about. How can she still be Nanami's friend?
Utena,Even though she's actually carrying all sorts of feelings...
Anthy,That's easy. 
Anthy,"For someone you love, your feelings for any other people become insignificant."
Anthy,You can deceive yourself as much as you need.
