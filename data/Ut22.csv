Akio,And so at last even the black rose comes to its final flower.
Akio,"However, I wonder if he himself will actually fight."

Miki,"We've got to find out who they really are, and quickly."
Miki,They're not trying to take the Rose Bride... They're trying to kill her!
Miki,"Needless to say, it's our duty for us of the Student Council enforcement division,"
Miki,"...as representatives of an autonomous body, to maintain order within the Academy."
Nanami,So true. Just who are these people who manipulate regular students and force them to duel TenjouUtena one after the other?
Juri,You're rather impatient. 
Juri,"Because your friends, and even Touga, have been targeted?"
Nanami,"As usual, you know everything. "
Nanam,"But, if your intelligence network is good enough to find that out,"
Nanami,"...then I want you to find out who these people are, and now!"
Miki,There is one clue. 
Juri,Only those people chosen by the Ends of the World should possess the Rose Signet.
Miki,"So, the shadowskulker may in fact be the Ends of the World, right?"
Juri,Who knows? 
Nanami,"But, looking ... evidence, that someone ... backed by ... of the World, right?"
Miki,"In any case, that ... must be ... in our quiet Academy."
Juri,"Pardon me, I couldn't hear you very well."
Utena,"Chuchu! Chuchu! Here, Chuchu! "
Utena,"Sheesh, now where could he have gone? "
Mikage,Does this creature belong to you? 
Utena,"Ah, Chuchu! "
Mikage,You're... 
Utena,Thanks. He give you any trouble? 
Mikage,"Not at all. I found him crying, caught in a mousetrap in the kitchen."
Utena,Mousetrap? 
Utena,"Behave yourself once in a while, 'kay? "
Mikage,Tenjou Utena-san... 
Utena,How'd you know my name? 
Mikage,Pleased to meet you. I've had an interest in you for quite some time.
Mikage,"I'm Mikage Souji, from the High School. "
Utena,Mikage? You're the brilliant high school student who runs the Mikage Seminar?
Mikage,"What do you say, Tenjou Utena-san? "
Mikage,Do you not feel like joining the Seminar? 
Utena,"Who, me? I... My last test was a makeup, you see..."
Mikage,This has nothing to do with academic prowess. My Seminar only seeks students with individual personalities.
Mikage,"You're perfectly welcome to come and see what it's like, at least."
Utena,"Your Seminar is held in this building here, isn't it?"
Mikage,"Yes, it is. Nemuro Memorial Hall. "
Mikage,"I guess you've heard all the rumors concerning this building, haven't you?"
Mikage,"If you're thinking about the story of a hundred boys dying here, that's true."
Mikage,"Long ago, there was a man known as Professor Nemuro."
Mikage,"There was a fire here, and his students were trapped inside and burned to death, they say."
Mikage,And this Nemuro Memorial Hall was remodeled sometime after.
Mikage,"However, "
Mikage,...that happened a long time ago. 
Utena,Anybody home? 
Utena,Akio-san? You here? 
Utena,He's not here... how strange. 
Mikage,"Oh, you... "
Mikage,I've done nothing more than make a deal with you.
Mikage,There's no reason for me to obey your orders.
Akio,True. That is our contract. 
Akio,Ever since that time... 
boy,"It doesn't seem to disappear too quickly, does it, Professor Nemuro?"
Mikage,"Eh, what's that? "
boy,"I was talking about the snow, Professor. "
Mikage,"Stop calling me Professor. We're about the same age, you know."
boy,But the distinction is important. 
boy,"With a genius like you here, our project has been jumpstarted."
Mikage,"Really now, you're making too much of it."
boy,"Putting that aside, I didn't think they were this extreme in the secrecy."
boy,"We're being treated like spare parts, so to speak."
Mikage,Didn't you agree to that when you made your contract with the Academy?
boy,"Yes, but we don't even know the research subject of our neighboring section."
boy,"Rumor has it that it has something to do with ""the power to revolutionize the world,"" or some researchabout ""grasping eternity."""
boy,Can't you even give us at least a hint? 
Mikage,Even I don't know anything beyond the rumors.
Mikage,"Furthermore, I'm not even interested. "
Mikage,"By the way, there's been something I've been meaning to ask."
boy,What is it? 
Mikage,What is that ring all of you wear on your left hands?
boy,"Oh, no special meaning. "
boy,It's the latest fashion. 
boy,"So that's Professor Nemuro, the genius? And he really doesn't know about our current research subject?"
boy,"Looks that way. But, the Professor's intellect is warranted by you-know-who."
boy,"His thesis is interesting, but the man himself is quite dry."
boy,People who act like they don't care about anything are unsophisticated.
boy,Let him act how he wants. That man is just like a computer.
boy,We should use him for all he's worth. 
Mikage,"At the time, I certainly was a computer-like man."
Mikage,"Though the computer is a peerless machine, machines themselves hold no purpose."
Mikage,"My dry self, those dry days... "
Mikage,And it is also true that I wasn't particularly interested in the research at that time.
Mikage,"And that which I participated in as a result wasn't progressing, but I didn't mind."
Tokiko,"You're the Research Coordinator, Professor Nemuro, right?"
Tokiko,I was sent by the Board of Directors. 
Tokiko,"I'm here as their current inspector, Chida Tokiko. Pleased to meet you."
Tokiko,The streets around here are bad. 
Tokiko,"It must have been difficult, with the roads all slushy."
Mikage,"Yes, well... "
Mikage,"You've called me all the way out to your house, so what do you want?"
Tokiko,It's too strong. 
Tokiko,"The tea seems a bit too strong, "
Tokiko,...even though I let it steam the same amount of time I usually do.
Tokiko,I wonder if even an hourglass can run slow.
Mikage,This job I was given is running its course as planned.
Mikage,"I can't guarantee completion, however. "
Tokiko,I know that you're not one for taking orders from others.
Tokiko,Genius is a godly thing. 
Tokiko,Its spirit can't be tied down to earth. 
Mikage,I'm not a genius. 
Tokiko,Why are you contributing to this project? 
Mikage,Purely for business reasons. 
Mikage,"As it is, I think I'm already working beyond my contract."
Mikage,"We've got one hundred excellent youths gathered together at Ohtori Academy, all pursuing this research."
Mikage,"They are saying that the purpose of this research is for the power to revolutionize the world,"
Mikage,"...or to grasp eternity, or something like that."
Mikage,To even think of grasping eternity... 
Mikage,It sounds like they're trying to build a perpetual motion machine.
Mikage,People should be humbly giving thanks for these God-given things.
Tokiko,"Yes, but you could... "
Tokiko,Excuse me for a moment. 
Tokiko,Mamiya! What are you doing? 
Tokiko,Weren't you told to stay in bed today? 
Mamiya,"Yes, but I got a bit worried about the roses."
Tokiko,Get back in bed right now! 
Mamiya,"Okay, in a moment. "
Tokiko,What I hate the most is someone who doesn't look after themself.
Tokiko,Sorry you had to see that. 
Tokiko,Hurry up and go to bed. 
Mamiya,"You're Professor Nemuro, aren't you? "
Mikage,And you are? 
Mamiya,"Chida Tokiko's brother, Mamiya. "
Mamiya,I've really wanted to meet you for the longest time.
Mikage,Because of the strange and interesting rumors?
Mikage,They say I'm a computer-like man. 
Mamiya,I've read your thesis. 
Mamiya,"You're the first person I ever respected, except for my sister."
Mamiya,My sister came to Ohtori Academy to meet you.
Tokiko,"Because you weren't sleeping quietly, that's why..."
Mamiya,I like it when you give me an injection. 
Tokiko,"Don't say such stupid things, you brat."
Tokiko,"It's for his sake, that I'm involved in this."
Tokiko,The doctors have told me that there's nothing left but to give up hope.
Tokiko,But if the research succeeds... 
Mikage,The research has nothing to do with medicine.
Mikage,"Even if it is a success, it may not help your brother's illness."
Tokiko,"But, maybe I could grasp eternity for him."
Tokiko,I'm sorry for crying like this. 
Mikage,It's all right. It feels like this is the first time I've ever seen a person's tears.
Tokiko,Is there someone important in your life?
Tokiko,Or perhaps those people known as geniuses never fall in love with other people?
Mikage,So it would seem. 
Mikage,"That is, up until today. "
boy,"Professor Nemuro is awfully excited about the project recently, isn't he?"
boy,Didn't the Board of Directors send an inspector?
boy,She really seems to be just right for the job.
boy,"Well, whatever you-know-who does is never in vain."
boy,"Then, does the Professor still not know what all this is about?"
Mikage,Shouldn't you be asleep right now? 
Mamiya,"It's okay, I'm feeling a bit better today."
Mikage,I see. 
Mamiya,"The snow in this garden doesn't disappear so easily, does it?"
Mamiya,"My sister was called out by the Board of Directors, so she probably won't be back until evening."
Mikage,"No, that's fine. "
Mikage,I only came here today to see your face.
Mamiya,"So, do you like it? "
Mamiya,It's a rose sugar-pickle. My sister makes them.
Mamiya,"These dry flowers are like them, too. "
Mamiya,"She doesn't want to see the flowers scatter, you see."
Mamiya,"When she does this, even the shortlived flowers can be made to last a little longer."
Mamiya,"But, I wonder if the flowers themselves are happy, being forced to last so long."
Mamiya,"Eternity doesn't exist in this world, does it?"
Mamiya,It's just that one could think that a heart that longs for eternity is beautiful.
Mikage,You don't think that what your sister and I are doing is going to succeed?
Mamiya,"I respect the two of you, and I'm grateful as well."
Mikage,Thank you for having me. I'll be back again sometime.
Mamiya,Professor Nemuro... 
Mikage,Yes? 
Mamiya,I'll be sure to tell my sister that you're worried about me.
Akio,You still can't solve that equation? 
Mikage,This place is off-limits to outsiders. 
Akio,There are no outsiders here. 
Akio,"Except for you, that is. "
Akio,That is the first step toward the power to revolutionize the world.
Akio,That will set everything in motion. 
Mikage,Ridiculous... How could anyone even execute such a plan?!
Mikage,"That's the ring everyone wears, isn't it?"
Akio,"It's the Rose Signet, the proof of a contract with me."
Mikage,Contract? 
Akio,Yes. 
Akio,All of the one hundred youths working here are contracted to me.
Mikage,That's crazy. What is this contract? 
Mikage,"And these boys bound by that contract, why are you subjecting them to this?"
Mikage,"Besides, even if I do grasp eternity by doing this, she won't be very happy."
Akio,"Ah, yes, her... "
Akio,"I'll leave this Rose Signet for you. Should you ever desire eternity, then put it on."
Akio,I suppose you have no choice but to revolutionize the world.
Akio,The way before you has been prepared. 
Tokiko,Is it true? Did you do this? 
Tokiko,Is this... Is this your doing? 
Mamiya,Yes. 
Tokiko,Why? 
Tokiko,How could you do such a thing? 
Mikage,Those boys had a contract. 
Mikage,"Ancient creatures died and left naught but fossil fuels, like coal and petroleum."
Mikage,"Without that sacrifice, our present energy civilization would not exist."
Mikage,That sort of sacrifice is what is always demanded.
Tokiko,What are you talking about? 
Mikage,This is the first step in the job you are advancing.
Mikage,"Soon, the road leading to eternity from this Academy will be opened."
Tokiko,Nemuro-san... 
Mikage,What Mamiya-kun did was proper. 
Mikage,"Now I, too, wish to grasp eternity. "
C-ko,Extra! Extra! Extra! 
C-ko,It's complete! The all-purpose robot made from the essences of science!
C-ko,A robot does not age. A robot does not tire.
C-ko,I catch the monkeys. 
C-ko,You are superior to humans. 
C-ko,A robot is superior. I catch many monkeys. 
C-ko,You cannot become worried. 
C-ko,A robot does not worry. 
C-ko,"When I see a monkey, I catch it quickly! "
C-ko,A robot is not lonely. 
C-ko,"I have all the monkeys I have caught. A robot can work indefinitely, and can catch many monkeys."
Tokiko,But those who look at you get lonely. 
C-ko,A monkey! A monkey! 
Akio,You... It's been quite a while. 
Tokiko,The Academy has changed a lot. 
Tokiko,"Just now over there, I saw Professor Nemuro."
Utena,"Now look, you don't have to do what these unknown people tell you!"
Anthy,But I can't help it. 
Anthy,"I am the Rose Bride, after all. "
Utena,Stupid! 
Utena,What I hate the most is someone who doesn't look after themself.
Mikage,Tokiko... 
Tokiko,"He hasn't aged a bit since then, just like you, hmm?"
Akio,"As long as they stay in this garden we call the Academy, a person will never become an adult."
Tokiko,"There's something wrong with that, though..."
Akio,Are you leading a normal life? 
Tokiko,"Yes, I am. My husband is a kind and generous man."
Akio,What did you come here for today? 
Tokiko,I came to visit my brother's... Mamiya's... grave.
Tokiko,"Say, even you should know. To bear fruit, flowers have to cast off their petals."
Akio,"Yes, indeed. "
