Mamiya,"Say, look. "
Mikage,Yeah... 
Mamiya,We're down to the last black rose. 
Mikage,Yeah... 
Mikage,"Tokiko, your brother is a sinful boy. "
Mikage,"However, from the sacrifice of one hundred young Duelists, we obtain true eternity."
Tokiko,Is it true? Did you do this? 
Tokiko,Is this your doing? 
Mamiya,Yes. 
Tokiko,Why? 
Tokiko,How could you do a thing like this? 
Mamiya,Tenjou Utena is so strong. 
Mikage,Yeah... 
Mamiya,I sense an unknown amount of strength in her.
Mikage,Yeah... 
Mamiya,"Say, look. "
Mamiya,We're down to the last black rose. 
Mikage,Yeah... 
Mikage,"For the life of me, I just can't come up with a sure-fire scenario."
Mikage,Isn't there any way besides allying myself with her?
Juri,Ally ourselves with Tenjou Utena? 
Nanami,Yes. Since some shadowy group is making their move.
Nanami,"At present, we should have the Engaged One cooperate with us."
Miki,"But Nanami-kun, you hate her, don't you? "
Nanami,"Well, I don't like her, but the Student Council's in a crisis."
Nanami,"Considering the circumstances, I think we should ally ourselves with her."
Nanami,How great of me! 
Nanami,"Onii-sama, I, Nanami, will protect this Student Council no matter what!"
Miki,"You say ""ally, ally,"" but... "
Juri,...it's not as if we are allies. 
Nanami,"Then, what are we? "
Miki,We are... 
Juri,...Duelists. 
Title,Qualifications of a Duelist 
Utena,Not here... 
Utena,Not here... 
Utena,"She's not here, either. "
Utena,Where did Himemiya go? 
Utena,"Now that she's not here either, there's no other place to search."
Utena,Maybe I shouldn't have been mad at her the other day.
Utena,"Honestly, when you have a friend like the Rose Bride, you're always worried."
Mikage,"Nice fragrance, isn't it? "
Utena,"Oh, Mikage-sempai. "
Mikage,"The modest scent from a single rose isn't bad,"
Mikage,...but I'm attracted to the fragrance of many roses too.
Mikage,"There's a tense atmosphere of mutual competition, you see."
Utena,Have you seen Himemiya anywhere? 
Mikage,"Well, who might that be? "
Utena,"My classmate, and she's been missing since this morning."
Mikage,"You're very considerate of your friends, aren't you?"
Utena,"It's not like that, but... "
Mikage,Did you give serious consideration to my offer from before?
Utena,Your offer from before? 
Mikage,About joining the Mikage Seminar. 
Utena,"Well, why a person like me? "
Mikage,You have a mysterious charm. 
Mikage,"To be quite honest, I find myself drawn to you."
Mikage,"If possible, I want to be by your side. "
Utena,"Oh, is that what it was? "
Utena,Such bold words. 
Mikage,"You quite welcome to just drop by, too. "
Mikage,"Besides, if you join us, we'll be of any help when you're in trouble."
Utena,"I don't mind just dropping in, but... "
Utena,"I don't really have any trouble, so I don't need anyone's help."
Utena,"See, if I brought Chuchu with me, he'd scatter cookie crumbs all over the place."
Utena,"It's really hard to clean up after him, and..."
Utena,Huh? 
Mikage,It doesn't have to be you personally. 
Mikage,Don't you have any troubled friends? 
Utena,Troubled friends? 
Utena,Troubled friends... 
Utena,Please don't open it. 
Utena,This coffin is meant for me. 
Utena,Being alive is rather sickening. 
Utena,Why does everyone go on living knowing they'll end up dying anyway?
Utena,I wonder why I never realized that until today.
Utena,"Eternity couldn't possibly exist, could it?"
Utena,"Oh, Himemiya's back. "
Utena,"Say, Himemiya... "
Utena,You really can't quit being the Rose Bride?
Utena,"A troubled friend, eh? "
Utena,Excuse me! 
Utena,Excuse me! 
Utena,Is anybody here? 
Utena,Hello?! 
Anthy,"My, I'm sleepy. "
Anthy,Why am I so sleepy these days? 
secretary,"A visitor, at the Entrance Hall. "
Mikage,Thank you. I'll be right there. 
secretary,"Well, there's a car waiting for me, so I'll be going now."
Mikage,I see. Thank you for the work you've done.
secretary,"Telling me to get out so suddenly was so like you, to the very end."
secretary,"That's just how it was the first time we met: you saying ""Be my secretary,"" out of the blue."
secretary,But it's all right. I can let my hair down now that I'm free of your yoke.
secretary,I wonder how I looked from your point of view.
Mikage,You are you. 
secretary,"You're certainly some kind of special person, perhaps one of the chosen."
secretary,"But the person I fell in love with wasn't a boy younger than me, like you."
Mikage,I am me. 
secretary,"Well then, goodbye. "
Utena,Huh? 
Utena,Kanae-san? 
Utena,"Kozue-chan, too... "
Utena,What the heck? 
boy,The road to the duel arena is now open. 
boy,"At last, that is about to begin. "
boy,"And now, Professor Nemuro's duty is finished. "
boy,"From now on, carrying on without him is probably what you-know-who plans on."
boy,Surely even he'll lose to someone. 
boy,We can just leave him by the wayside. 
boy,"Well then, let's open the champagne. "
Mamiya,How selfish they are. 
Mamiya,"They owe it to you that the castle appeared and the road to the arena opened, right?"
Mamiya,They're all afraid of you. 
Mamiya,They think you may be capable of obtaining eternity.
Nemuro,I'm not going to do anything like dueling. 
Mamiya,Why not? Aren't you thinking you want the power to revolutionize the world for your very own?
Mamiya,Knowing eternity exists in that castle? 
Mamiya,"Eternity means lasting forever, right? "
Mamiya,"For years, decades, centuries, millennia, eons, and on and on."
Mamiya,"My life may be just a moment, but... "
Mamiya,"Eternity means that this moment lasts billions of billions of years, without end."
Mamiya,I... I... 
Mamiya,I want eternity. 
Tokiko,What are you talking about? 
Nemuro,This is the first step of the job you're advancing.
Nemuro,"Soon, the road leading to eternity from this Academy will be opened."
Tokiko,Nemuro-san... 
Nemuro,What Mamiya-kun did was proper. 
Nemuro,"Now I, too, wish to grasp eternity. "
Mikage,You're finally back. 
Mikage,I knew you'd come back to me sooner or later.
Mikage,"Tokiko-san, you don't have to regret the fact that you deserted me."
Utena,"Mikage-sempai, you... "
Utena,"Mikage-sempai, are you the one who manipulated them?"
Mikage,Manipulated them? Surely not. 
Mikage,All of these people were members of the Mikage Seminar.
Mikage,They all had their unforgettable memories. 
Mikage,"Precious, precious memories... "
Mikage,They proceeded to fight to protect their memories.
Mikage,"They are, in a manner of speaking, people who tried to change their lives according to their memories."
Utena,Memories? 
Mikage,What about you? 
Utena,"We can meet again, can't we? "
Utena,"Prince, we can meet again, can't we? "
Utena,"Until then, I won't cry, and I'll be patient no matter what."
Mikage,"For you, it's possible to make the memory last forever, just like I did."
Mikage,That's what the world needs. 
Mikage,The path before you has be- 
Utena,You bastard!! 
Utena,Who the hell is this World?! 
Utena,"Don't lump me together with the likes of you, you manipulative..."
Mikage,Don't get so excited. 
Mikage,"You sound like you're yelling out, ""Don't touch my precious memory!"""
Utena,What did you say?! 
Utena,Don't even talk like you understand me! 
Utena,My memory is... 
Mikage,I see. It's that memory that's been supporting you up until now.
Mikage,No need to be ashamed. 
Mikage,Because the memory you possess is a worthy one.
Mikage,"Only those with beautiful memories are allowed to wish,"
Mikage,"""If only those days could last forever, if only I could still be what I was back then."""
Mikage,I know that you're the same as myself. 
Mikage,Your eyes are like those people who can't help wanting to make memories last forever.
Utena,I challenge you to a duel! Come to the Duel Arena tonight!
Utena,I'll beat you to a pulp and prove that I'm different from you!
Mamiya,"Sempai, why did you call her? "
Mamiya,Why are you keeping quiet? 
Mamiya,What's so funny? 
Mikage,"Hey, look. "
Mikage,It's a tear. 
Mamiya,A tear? 
Mikage,It seems the pain made an inadvertent tear come forth.
Mikage,"If she hadn't found my Rose Signet, "
Mikage,...I could have been killed right then and there.
Mamiya,You sound like you're having fun. 
Mikage,"Indeed, she hurts me and surprises me all the time."
Mikage,"Just as I thought, Tokiko has returned, to settle the score with me once and for all."
Mamiya,Do you intend to accept the duel? 
Mikage,"In the final analysis, we haven't advanced at all since then."
Mikage,"But, she's closer to the Power of Dios than we are."
Mikage,We can't proceed without defeating her. 
Mikage,"Rose blooming at the Ends of the World, to me!"
Mikage,Your eyes are just like those of those people who can't stop wanting to make memories last forever.
Wakaba,Uuuteeenaaa! 
Wakaba,"Hey, you haven't forgotten your ultra-best friend Wakaba-sama lately, have you?"
Utena,"No, I haven't. "
Wakaba,"No matter what happens, I'm on your side, Utena."
C-ko,Extra! Extra! Extra! 
C-ko,Your pop was a class rep at your age. 
C-ko,"Wow, that's great, Pop! "
C-ko,"Hey, you, what's with this paperwork? It's terrible!"
C-ko,"Shit, even though I was a class rep back when!"
C-ko,"Honey, you can't just leave your socks here when you take them off, it's terrible!"
C-ko,"Shit, even though I was a class rep back when!"
C-ko,"Well, I'm off to school, Pop! "
C-ko,Wait! Give me that school backpack! Your pop'll go to school!
Wakaba,See you later! 
Utena,...the power to revolutionize the world! 
Mikage,Here we go. 
Mikage,Well received. 
Mikage,However... 
Mikage,I'm not in full form yet. The shoulder you screwed up is still aching.
Mikage,But I don't think I'm going to lose to you!
Utena,Quit joking around! You think I'm going to be beaten by some string-pulling bastard from the shadows?
Mikage,That's not how it happened. 
Mikage,Those who received my black roses came to my place of their own free will.
Mikage,"Then, they stood in this place of their own free will."
Mikage,Anyone who stands here is the same as myself. They come lured by eternity.
Utena,Shut up! Don't accuse other people of what you did for yourself!
Mikage,I knew since the first time I saw you. 
Mikage,"You met the person important to you long ago, right?"
Mikage,"And so, that person changed your life forever, right?"
Mikage,You're standing here on the strength of that illusion.
Mikage,That's why you were able to enter the Duel Arena.
Mikage,Am I wrong? 
Mikage,"After all, you're just like me. "
Mikage,"And right here, right here I will defeat you, Tokiko!"
Utena,What nonsense are you talking about? I won't lose to a bastard like you!
Mikage,"You're such a stubborn girl, Tokiko. "
Mikage,Seems you won't get it unless I destroy that rose.
Mikage,I knew you would jump! 
Utena,"Oh, no! "
Anthy,Utena-sama! 
Anthy,Utena-sama! 
Utena,Himemiya! 
Utena,Himemiya! 
Anthy,Utena-sama! 
Mamiya,"Sempai, you're going to lose now. "
Mikage,Mamiya! 
Mamiya,You're going to get your rose destroyed by her.
Mikage,What did you say?! 
Mikage,"Where are you, Mamiya? Mamiya! "
Mikage,Mamiya! 
Mikage,Who... 
Mikage,Who is this? 
Mamiya,You can't defeat her. 
Mamiya,"You'll never defeat the sister of mine within your memory, not for all eternity."
Mikage,Tokiko! 
Mikage,Eternity is right here before my eyes! 
Mikage,I'll defeat you and grasp the power to change the world with these very hands!
Mikage,Why don't you understand me?! 
Mikage,I accept everything! 
Mikage,Even your brother's sin! 
Mamiya,"Sempai, now watch carefully. "
Mamiya,"At that time, at that place, who was actually there and who was not?"
Mamiya,Who actually set fire to that building? 
Mikage,Mamiya... 
Mikage,It's been a long time. 
Mikage,How many decades has it been since I saw you last?
Akio,"Ah, Nemuro-kun. I was thinking it was about time you called me."
Akio,"Yes. The boy called Mamiya that you were keeping with you from your lingering attachment to Tokiko, dieda long time ago."
Akio,I exploited the illusion you cherished in your memory so much that you even halted your own time.
Akio,"The period where you hid the possibility in your heart, not growing up, was useful."
Akio,"However, that's all over. "
Akio,"From now on, the path before you is not prepared."
Akio,"You, graduate now. "
Utena,"Oh, darn it. "
Utena,What a weird place we ended up in while searching for Himemiya.
Miki,There was a really big fire here a long time ago.
Utena,Really? So there really was that kind of trouble.
Miki,"It seems there weren't any casualties, but since it was before the time of the Student Council, no recordsremain."
Miki,Let's see... What was the building called? Kushiro Memorial Hall...
Miki,Sounds wrong. Noboribetsu Memorial Hall? Argh! I hate it when I can't remember!
Utena,Himemiya! Where did you go? 
Akio,What's wrong? Are you sympathizing with him?
Akio,"But now, he doesn't exist in this academy. "
Akio,"No, never has he from the beginning. "
Akio,In the same way as you haven't.
