Tsuwabuki,"All this morning, it's classes as usual. 3rd period Music is about music appreciation."
Tsuwabuki,The topic is Orff's Karmina Burana. The report you will present is already complete.
Tsuwabuki,"Before you go to the Music room, take a look inside your locker."
Tsuwabuki,"6th period English, there's a vocabulary test, so here's your cribsheet."
Nanami,I see. 
Tsuwabuki,I'll inform you of your afterschool plans at lunchtime. After that-
Nanami,Tsuwabuki... 
Tsuwabuki,"Yes, ma'am? "
Nanami,Thank you. 
Tsuwabuki,Certainly! 
Boy,A runaway horse! 
Boy,A horse is on the loose! 
Tsuwabuki,Watch out! 
Tsuwabuki,My name is Tsuwabuki Mitsuru. 
Tsuwabuki,I am a student who has dedicated all of myself to Nanami-san.
Tsuwabuki,"And so, I have a secret that absolutely no one must know!"
text,Nanami-sama Secret Diary 
Utena,Tsuwabuki-kun's been hurt? 
Nanami,"Yes, while protecting me. "
Himemiya,Did he die? 
Nanami,Of course not! 
Nanami,"The wound itself looks like little more than a bruise and a broken nail,"
Nanami,...but he's still unconscious. 
Nanami,"Right now, I'm having them arrange a hospital for him."
Himemiya,Hmm? What's this? 
Utena,A schedule book? 
Nanami,"Oh, that's Tsuwabuki's. "
Utena,So he's got names and addresses and stuff written in here?
Himemiya,It has diary-type things written in it.
Nanami,What? Read it! 
Himemiya,"""My name is Tsuwabuki Mitsuru."" "
Himemiya,"""I am a student who has dedicated all of myself to Nanami-san."""
Tsuwabuki,I have always had my eye on Nanami-san. 
Tsuwabuki,...and only Nanami-san. 
Keiko,It's your fault! 
Keiko,You snared our Saionji-san and turned him into a loser!
Yuuko,"He's been away from the Kendo Club, too! "
Aiko,What a dreadful girl! 
Keiko,Give us back our Saionji-san! 
Aiko,Say something! 
Nanami,Whatever is going on here? 
Keiko,Nanami-sama... 
Nanami,"Pray tell, what is all this commotion? "
Nanami,"Given the circumstances, I'll have to report this to the Student Council."
Keiko,"Well, uh... "
Aiko,It's not what it seems. 
KYA,Excuse us! 
Nanami,Are you alright? 
Himemiya,"Yes, thank you. "
Himemiya,"You're... Nanami-san, they said it was?"
Nanami,"Since you're so popular among the boys, "
Nanami,...you tend to make them jealous. 
Tsuwabuki,Nanami-san is incredible. 
Tsuwabuki,"With purity, nobility and great beauty, "
Tsuwabuki,"...protecting the weak, detesting all evil, entirely for justice in the Academy."
Tsuwabuki,"But, I know... "
Tsuwabuki,I know Nanami-san's naked face. 
Utena,Nanami's naked face? 
Nanami,What's with those looks? 
Utena,"Looks like he knows you through and through, from shiny surface to filthy underbelly."
Nanami,What do you mean by filthy underbelly? 
Keiko,"Nanami-sama, she's come wearing the dress we sent her."
Aiko,It really suits her. 
Boy,"Oh, I apologize, Miss! "
Himemiya,It's all right. 
Tsuwabuki,"Never dirtying her own hands, "
Tsuwabuki,"...her stoic manner in which she merely watches the suffering from a safe distance,"
Tsuwabuki,...certainly is the proper form for she who rules the Academy from the shadows.
Utena,"Yeah, something like that happened. "
Himemiya,"So that was Nanami-san's doing, wasn't it?"
Nanami,Th- that's all Tsuwabuki's delusions! 
Nanami,It's unimaginable that I would do something so wild.
Nanami,"Tsuwabuki sure is a weird kid, huh? "
Tsuwabuki,Nanami-san's malice didn't end at that level.
Tsuwabuki,As in this case... 
Keiko,Nanami-sama... 
Keiko,"8th Grade, Class A, has started cooking practice, as scheduled."
Nanami,So it appears. 
Nanami,And what we were discussing earlier? 
Keiko,"Yes, ma'am, I just made the substitution. "
Keiko,"100X curry, an Indian specialty hot enough to make you breathe fire."
Nanami,Excellent. 
Nanami,"Watch out, Tenjou Utena and Himemiya Anthy."
Nanami,I'll soon have you begging for mercy. 
SYT,Curry... 
SYT,curry... 
SYT,curry... 
SYT,CURRY!! 
Himemiya,It's ready! 
Keiko,Nanami-sama! 
Nanami,"Be quiet, it's getting good now. "
Keiko,"I'm sorry, but, um.. "
Nanami,But what? 
Aiko,The substitution wasn't for 100X curry... 
Keiko,"It appears to be for super spicy 900 Billion X curry,"
Keiko,...so hot it'll blast you to smithereens and make phantom elephants trumpet loudly.
Nanami,Phantom... smithereens? 
Nanami,No way... 
Tsuwabuki,Tenjou-san and Himemiya-san... 
Tsuwabuki,"That's right, their personalities were exchanged by Nanami-san's curry."
Himemiya,"Utena-sama, that's wonderful! "
Utena,"Well, it feels weird being praised by my own body."
Himemiya,"You see, I'm not very good at sports, "
Himemiya,...so seeing my own body acting so wonderfully makes me happy.
Utena,"But, we gotta think of a way to return to normal."
Himemiya,Don't worry! 
Himemiya,I'm sure even now Nanami-sama is... 
Tsuwabuki,"Right. Nanami-san put forth her best efforts,"
Tsuwabuki,...to atone for her sin without losing her cheerful smile.
Keiko,Nanami-sama! 
Nanami,An elephant?! 
Keiko,Nanami-sama! 
Nanami,Not again! 
Aiko,Nanami-sama! 
Tsuwabuki,Here's a souvenir. 
Tsuwabuki,"Then, Nanami-san came back, stronger than ever."
Touga,Nanami! 
Nanami,Onii-sama!! 
Touga,Nanami! The replacement? 
Nanami,That was the last one. 
Nanami,They said it will take another 200 years to refine it to 900 Billion X spice.
All,200 years? 
Tsuwabuki,"Surely, I thought it looked like karmic retribution."
Himemiya,"Now that you mention it, that was the case."
Utena,"Nanami is just thoroughly evil, isn't she?"
Nanami,What are you talking about?! 
Nanami,"It wasn't the curry I substituted that switched your personalities,"
Nanami,"...it was purely because of your cooking skills, am I not right?"
Himemiya,Was it? 
Nanami,You... 
Utena,"So what other evil deeds are written after that, I wonder?"
Nanami,"Wait a second, aside from that, "
Nanami,...is there anything about Tsuwabuki in there?
Himemiya,There's nothing written but stuff about Nanami-san.
Tsuwabuki,Nanami-san seems to have been treating Himemiya-san badly for any reason at all.
Tsuwabuki,As in this case... 
Miki,"Huh, they say this dorm is haunted, but it's actually quite nice inside."
Nanami,You have such a nice room. 
Utena,"Yeah, Himemiya cleans up religiously everyday."
Miki,"Himemiya-san must really like to keep things neat, then."
Nanami,"Wow, I'm really impressed. "
Nanami,"Ok, just watch. "
Nanami,Think Himemiya Anthy's a cute girl while you can...
Miki,"I envy you, Tenjou-sempai, living with such a feminine girl."
Utena,Is that sarcasm? 
Nanami,"Himemiya-sempai, may I borrow your eraser? "
Nanami,It's a snail! 
Nanami,It's a snake! 
Nanami,There's an octopus in here! 
Nanami,Himemiya's true character has been exposed! 
Nanami,That's what's going to happen! 
Tsuwabuki,"However, Nanami-san also had a tough time."
Tsuwabuki,"Sometimes, the wounding party gets hurt instead of the intended target."
Nanami,"Himemiya-sempai, may I borrow your eraser? "
Nanami,"Himemiya Anthy, prepare yourself! "
Utena,I wouldn't open that if I were you. 
Nanami,"This can't be true, it must be a dream. "
Nanami,This huge octupus and its octupus tentacles... 
Utena,"You really are evil, aren't you? "
Nanami,Evil? Moi? 
Nanami,You have got to be kidding me! 
Nanami,"That time, it was me that was the victim, wasn't it?"
Himemiya,"""And so, Nanami-san has been hostile toward Himemiya-san, but..."""
Nanami,"St- st- st- st- st- stop that, I wasn't hostile or anything."
Utena,You don't have to play dumb anymore. 
Himemiya,"""...there's a reason for that. A profound reason, which must not be uttered to another soul..."""
Utena,Reason? 
Utena,Oh. 
Nanami,"Hey, stop already! And give that back! "
Utena,Thought this wasn't yours? 
Himemiya,"You're going to tear that apart, you know!"
Nanami,"You inhuman, demon, villain! "
Utena,That's you! 
Nanami,What is it? 
Utena,Can you hear it? 
Nanami,What? 
Himemiya,That slight tooth-grinding. 
Himemiya,Like a rope bridge swaying in the wind.
Nanami,"No, it's the sound of a seaside swingset squeaking."
Himemiya,"He who once ruled the Student Council, Touga-sempai."
Nanami,Guess who! 
Touga,"Stop it, Nanami. "
Nanami,"It's such a lovely evening, isn't it? Onii-sama..."
Touga,"You're such a baby, little sister. "
Tsuwabuki,"For Nanami-san, Touga-sempai is her entire world."
Nanami,You two!! 
Utena,"""Only Touga-sempai could be the one and only man to live up to Nanami-san's ideals."""
Tsuwabuki,"Even though I'm still inexperienced, someday I want to be a big brother like Touga-sempai."
Utena,"C'mon, let's stop. "
Himemiya,Oh? 
Utena,It's not right. All his thoughts are packed in this book.
Utena,"And here we are, peeking at it... "
Nanami,"You've read almost everything, so who cares about the weight of Tsuwabuki-kun's feelings?"
Nanami,How about the weight of my feelings? 
Utena,About 49 kilos? 
Nanami,I've gained?! 
Himemiya,"Oh, I wonder what's on this page. "
Himemiya,Operation the First... 
Nanami,"Did you say ""operation?"" "
Nanami,Where am I? 
Nanami,Who am I? 
Nanami,It's no use. I can't remember anything. 
Touga,Nanami... 
Nanami,Who's there? 
Touga,Have you forgotten? 
Tsuwabuki,"It's me, your older brother. "
Nanami,Onii-sama?! 
Tsuwabuki,"Come here, Nanami! "
Nanami,ONII-SAMA!! 
Nanami,"Wait, what is this? "
Utena,Beats me. 
Himemiya,Operation the Second... 
Tsuwabuki,"Arrrrggh, wait a minute! "
Nanami,Tsuwabuki... 
Tsuwabuki,"Please, don't read any further! "
Nanami,Now what are you talking about? 
Nanami,All your plots will be thoroughly exposed! 
Tsuwabuki,"What do you mean, plots? "
Tsuwabuki,"All I wanted was to become the kind of man that suits you, Nanami-san."
Nanami,Why you little...! 
Utena,"Nanami, calm down! If you get too excited, you'll turn into a cow again!"
Himemiya,"Operation the Second... When Nanami-san becomes a cow again,"
Himemiya,"And this time, I think I can cope with that this way."
Utena,Nanami! 
Utena,Get rid of that cowbell! 
Utena,Get rid of it! 
Nanami,"Shut up already, moo. "
Utena,Do you even know what the bell on your neck is supposed to be?
Nanami,"Really, moo! It's a Sebastian Dior cowbell, right? Really, moo!"
Utena,A cowbell is just a bell they hang on a cow's neck.
Nanami,What are you talking about? Moo. 
Utena,Look around you! 
Nanami,"So, so, Sebastian Dior, the purveyor to the Court is..."
Utena,"It's not Sebastian Dior, but Koushi-chan Dior! (koushi = calf)"
Nanami,Ko- Koushi-chan? 
Utena,"You didn't even know what a cowbell is all about,"
Utena,"...and you were all proud of that humongous bell, wearing it on your neck."
Utena,What you're doing now is exactly what a cow does!
Nanami,Cow? 
Utena,We can't do anything about that now. 
Utena,What you can do now is throw that bell away before you completely turn into a cow.
Nanami,Wh- What are you talking about? Moo. 
Nanami,How could I possibly become a cow? Moo. 
Nanami,"Really now, don't surprise me. Moo. Quit kidding around, already. Moo."
Himemiya,"Utena-sama, it's finally finished! "
Utena,What's this? 
Himemiya,It's a sweater. 
Utena,"Thanks, but it's a bit out of season, isn't it?"
Nanami,"Moo. If it had gone a little more, moo, I would have attracted intense attention."
Nanami,"Somehow, my mind is getting, moo, fuzzy... "
Nanami,"Could it be a delusion, moo? My appendix, moo?"
Nanami,"Or I might have been bitten by a, moo, virulent poisonous snake..."
Nanami,"Somebody, moo, get me a blanket! "
Utena,Nanami... 
Utena,"Nanami, you look... "
Himemiya,I'm scared! 
Tsuwabuki,Nanami-san! 
Himemiya,She's coming right for us! 
Utena,"Oh, I get it! She got all excited when she saw this red sweater!"
Himemiya,"Oh, my! "
Utena,"Himemiya, get away! "
Himemiya,All right! 
Tsuwabuki,It's all right now. 
Tsuwabuki,"It's all right now, Nanami-san. "
Tsuwabuki,"I'll take care of you, even if you do become a cow."
Tsuwabuki,"I'll stay with you, Nanami-san. "
Tsuwabuki,"Stop it, stop it, please! "
Nanami,"Don't be such a poor sport, Tsuwabuki! "
Tsuwabuki,Don't look! 
Nanami,Where am I? 
Tsuwabuki,"Ah, you're conscious... How do you feel?"
Nanami,What do you have written there? 
Tsuwabuki,"You fell behind schedule, didn't you?"
Tsuwabuki,I've been rescheduling. 
Nanami,"Really, how goes it? I want to see. "
Tsuwabuki,I'll tell you about it later. 
Tsuwabuki,No need to worry. 
Nanami,I've got it now! 
Tsuwabuki,"Oh, crap! "
Nanami,"So it seems there are nasty things written in here, eh?"
Nanami,Seize him! 
Tsuwabuki,St- St- St- St- St- Stop!! Let me go! Let me goooo!
Nanami,"What's this, Operation the Twenty-fourth? "
Tsuwabuki,"I'm done for! If they read that page, I'm done for!"
C-ko,Extra! Extra! 
C-ko,I'm done for! I'm really done for! 
C-ko,Why is that? 
C-ko,"My secret which can't stay hidden any longer is,"
C-ko,...that the king has the ears of a donkey! 
C-ko,"Did you say ""donkey?"" "
C-ko,"Sorry, not a donkey. "
C-ko,"The truth is, I am... "
C-ko,...a monkey hiding behind a girl's face! 
C-ko,"Ah, the shame of it all. Now she'll never get married."
C-ko,Monkey is captured. Monkey is captured. 
ED,Missing truth and forever 
ED,Kissing love and true your heart 
ED,Embrace me with your true arms 
ED,The key to open up tomorrow is reality 
ED,I want to keep on destroying lies.

ED,so I want to keep lies hating me.
