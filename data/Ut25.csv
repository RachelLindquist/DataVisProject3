Touga,You're driving quite fast. 
Akio,"She's purring nicely, don't you think? Care to take the wheel?"
Touga,What? But I still don't... 
Akio,You're too strict... 
Touga,"That was a rather indecent proposal, Mr. Chairman."
Akio,"My Ohtori Academy has a regard for students' independence, Mr. President."
title,Our Eternal Apocalypse 
Akio,Yes? 
Wakaba,"Umm, I'm a friend of Tenjou Utena, and... "
Akio,"Ah, hold on a second. "
Akio,Please come in. 
Wakaba,Th- th- thanks. 
Anthy,"Oh, welcome. "
Utena,"Hey, Wakaba! "
Wakaba,Ta-dah! I came over to help you! 
Utena,Thanks! 
Wakaba,"Wow, this is so cool! "
Wakaba,Much nicer than your old room in that haunted mansion.
Utena,But it's a bit too large. 
Wakaba,"Well, whatever you say, it's just beautiful. "
Wakaba,"It's really like, ""Hey, I'm super lucky!"" you know!"
Utena,I think so. It is a nice room. 
Wakaba,I'm not talking about the room. 
Utena,Huh? 
Wakaba,How dreamy... 
Utena,What is? 
Wakaba,The chairman! The chairman! 
Wakaba,"That smile, is that what they call an angel's smile?"
Wakaba,"Living under the same roof with a man like that,"
Wakaba,"...and an exciting, romantic development coming along, I envy you!"
Utena,"Look, Wakaba, Akio-san's already got a fiancee."
Wakaba,He does? 
Utena,Yep. 
Wakaba,I wonder why all the good men in this world are already taken.
Utena,"There, there. "
Akio,What's already taken? 
Akio,Won't you have some tea? 
Wakaba,All right! 
Akio,"Since we don't have any other family, I want to be near my sister, of course."
Akio,"But it's cruel to separate her from the friend she finally made,"
Akio,...so I had to be so unreasonable to ask Utena-san to move in as well.
Utena,What a considerate brother. 
Wakaba,I- I'm a good friend of Anthy-san too! 
Akio,Please continue to be her friend. 
Wakaba,Sure! 
Wakaba,"Here, Himemiya-san, would you like another cup of tea?"
Anthy,Thank you. 
Utena,Come on... 
Wakaba,"What, you got a problem? "
Utena,"No, not really. "
Wakaba,"What? I'm always like this, aren't I? "
Juri,"Where had you been until you returned to school, Saionji?"
Saionji,That is of no concern. 
Saionji,"At any rate, I'm not going to duel anymore."
player,Lead lead lead... 
Nanami,How's that? 
Saionji,Because what the letters say cannot be trusted.
umpire,Strike! 
Juri,Having been tricked by the counterfeit letter seems to have taught you a lesson...
Miki,The contents of the letter have already been verified.
player,All right! All right! 
Miki,"Certainly, when I passed through the Rose Gate,"
umpire,Strike! 
Miki,"...at the center of the caracole to the Duel Arena,"
umpire,Strike! 
Miki,...a gondola appeared. 
umpire,Strike! Batter out! 
Nanami,"So, what about this gondola? "
Miki,I understand that it will advance us to a new stage.
Saionji,It doesn't matter to me whether the text of the letter is true or false.
Saionji,I have no recollection of becoming a subordinate of the Ends of the World.
umpire,Out! Out! Game's over! 
Saionji,I flatly refuse to fight by someone's order.
Nanami,Kyouichi! 
Saionji,Don't try to stop me. 
Nanami,"Honestly. I'd refuse that, too. "
Miki,"Well, even so... "
Juri,Who on earth is this Ends of the World? 
Akio,It's that star. It looked more vivid than usual today.
Utena,Uh... Which one is it? 
Akio,"See, right there. "
Utena,Oh? 
Akio,"All right, look at the tip of my hand. "
Akio,That star conspicuously sparkling up there is Venus.
Utena,Ah... 
Akio,The Morning Star... 
Akio,"My name, Akio, was derived from the name of this star."
Utena,"Wow, that sounds kind of romantic. "
Akio,"The Morning Star, "
Akio,...also known as Lucifer. 
Utena,Lucifer? 
Akio,"The star that was originally an angel, but chose to become the Devil."
Akio,"If you look up from this earth, it's always by the Sun."
Akio,"And unless the Sun sinks, it can never shine."
Akio,And what do you suppose it thinks when it does shine?
Utena,Himemiya... 
Anthy,"I just heard that dinner is ready, Utena-sama. "
Utena,R- Really? I'm starving. 
Utena,"Well then, Akio-san, if you'll excuse me..."
Utena,"Akio-san is a nice person, isn't he? "
Anthy,Yes. 
Utena,But... 
Anthy,But? 
Utena,"Whenever he's talking about stars, his eyes look lonely."
Utena,Like someone who lost something important... 
Utena,"Still, somehow he gives me the feeling that I've known him before."
Anthy,"There are times when I feel I've known you before too, Utena-sama."
Utena,Me? 
Anthy,Yes. 
Utena,It's unusual for you to say something like that.
Anthy,I'm sorry. 
Utena,"No, I'm glad. "
Utena,"Hey, if something ever troubles you, come talk to me about it first."
Utena,"No matter what, we'll help each other. "
Utena,That's the kind of friends I want us to be.
Anthy,"I understand. From now on, you and I will help each other to go on living."
Anthy,Utena-sama... 
Anthy,"Actually, I... "
Utena,What? 
Anthy,Nothing. 
Touga,Scrubbing the floor this late in the night?
Touga,You remain as upright as ever. 
Touga,You'll be the champion of the local tournament this year again.
Saionji,One of the reasons that I hate you is the way you're conceited now.
Touga,Oh? 
Saionji,You are right. I will be the champion again this year.
Saionji,But you think that that's meaningless child's play... and you're laughing in your heart.
Touga,That's not true. 
Saionji,"After all, in this world, battles are only won by the strong."
Saionji,"Even if you're conceited with your cheap tricks, don't forget that you lost to Tenjou Utena as well."
Touga,As have you. 
Touga,"Furthermore, I hear that someone I know said he's quitting the duels now."
Touga,"However, I have not yet given up. "
Touga,There's someone I want you to meet. 
Touga,Someone you want me to meet? 
Touga,"You haven't really given up either, have you?"
Touga,"Listen, can't you hear it? "
Saionji,Hear what? 
Touga,"So long as your soul hasn't given up entirely,"
Touga,"...then you should be able to hear this sound,"
Touga,...running about the ends of the world. 
Saionji,What nonsense... 
Saionji,What the... What is this?! 
Touga,"Then come, journey with us, to the world which you desire!"
Saionji,"So, you're the Trustee Board Chairman who's engaged to Ohtori's daughter."
Touga,"Yes, and Himemiya Anthy's older brother. "
Touga,Do you want the Rose Bride? 
Saionji,What do you mean? 
Touga,Exactly what I said. 
Touga,What do you want? What are you aiming for? What do you want to be?
Saionji,What's the point in asking things like that?
Saionji,"First of all, I have no trust in the likes of you."
Touga,"Come on, aren't you my one and only friend? "
Saionji,There's no such thing as friendship in this world.
Touga,Is that so? 
Saionji,That is so. 
Touga,I wonder... 
Touga,I wonder if you really believe that. 
Saionji,What are you getting at? 
Touga,"Well then, why are you striving for that castle said to hold eternity?"
Touga,"Isn't that because you believe that if you get there, you will find something eternal,"
Touga,"...for example, eternal friendship or something?"
Touga,Do you remember that girl who was in the coffin a long time ago?
Saionji,"Something like that happened, I suppose. "
Touga,"There was a girl who was saying she wanted to see eternity, right?"
Saionji,I'm not sure. I barely remember it. 
Touga,The one who saved that girl from the coffin that night was Akio-san here.
Saionji,What? 
Touga,She was saved because Akio-san showed her something eternal.
Saionji,Say what?! Who the hell are you? 
Akio,"She's purring nicely, don't you think? "
Saionji,What are you talking about? 
Akio,"The ends of the world, I will show... to you."
Saionji,You couldn't be... 
Utena,How should I know when I don't receive any letters from the Ends of the World?
Miki,"So you don't know, then. "
Utena,"So, what were you saying about the stairway to the Duel Arena?"
Miki,You know how the stairway spirals around the central pillar?
Utena,Yeah. 
Miki,There's something like a gondola inside the column.
Utena,Gondola? 
Saionji,That's right. 
Saionji,That gondola is the set of wings that fly toward the ends of the world.
Saionji,And it will carry me and the Rose Bride to the castle said to hold eternity.
Utena,Saionji... 
Miki,"You no longer duel, do you? "
Saionji,"Unfortunately, I am not the same man I was yesterday."
Miki,What are you saying is different about you?
Saionji,Can't you see? 
Miki,No. 
Utena,I have no idea what you're talking about. 
Saionji,"I see, so you don't know. "
Saionji,Not that you would understand even if I told you...
Miki,What do you intend to do? 
Utena,Micky! 
Utena,Are you all right? 
Saionji,The Rose Bride belongs to me. 
Utena,"Let go of Himemiya, Saionji! "
A-ko,"I wonder, I wonder... Do you know what I wonder?"
B-ko,I hear there's going to be another duel out back in the forest today!
A-ko,It's been quite a while since this phrase was last used.
A-ko,"Of course, it's better done by two people... "
B-ko,...than by one! 
A-ko,"Half the suffering, "
A-ko&B-ko,...double the happiness! 
A-ko,"Hey, wait! You used my shampoo without permission last night!"
B-ko,"And you, you went and finished off the pudding I was eating."
B-ko,...though it was from two weeks ago. 
A-ko,Are you serious? 
B-ko,"But now, brave warrior, "
A-ko,I wonder if you really know... 
B-ko,...the difficulty in getting along together. 
A-ko,"I wonder, I wonder... "
A-ko&B-ko,Do you know what I wonder? 
A-ko,Ugh... Here it comes.

Utena,"I wish you would learn when to quit, Sempai."
Utena,"If you really love Himemiya, try putting yourself in her shoes for once."
Saionji,Indeed. Long ago I did think about the Rose Bride's feelings.
Saionji,That's why I got so heated. But now I know.
Saionji,The Rose Bride has no will of her own. 
Utena,"Looks like you just won't get it unless I stomp you down, I guess."
Utena,"Himemiya, the sword! "
Saionji,I'm no longer the me who lost to you. Because I saw!
Utena,You saw? 
Saionji,Yes! 
Utena,What are you saying you saw? 
Saionji,The world. 
Utena,It's vanished. 
Touga,The Sword of Dios vanished.

Touga,Of course.

Akio,The Sword of Dios didn't appear.
