Akio,We must defeat Tenjou Utena immediately and engage the Rose Brideto somebody else.
Touga,Oh? Wasn't Tenjou Utena supposed to be the golden goose?
Akio,The golden goose is valuable because it lays golden eggs.
Touga,"My, how selfish. So, which piece will you move?"
title,Miki's Nest Box (Sunlit Garden - Arrange Version)
crowd,What's going on? 
crowd,"Hey, that's dangerous! "
crowd,What the-? 
crowd,What's she doing? 
Utena,Kozue-chan! 
Anthy,"My, how awful. "
girl,Just forget about that thing and use both hands.
girl,You're really gonna fall! 
Miki,Kozue! 
Kozue,Miki... 
girl,"Man, what a scare. "
girl,But why'd she go and do something like that?
girl,"Well, when she heard that tree was gonna be cut down after school today,"
girl,she climbed right out the window onto to the ledge to save the little birds' nest in the branches.
girl,"Kozue's pretty cool most of the time, but sometimes she just does the weirdest things."
Miki,You're all hot and sticky. Don't lean on me.
Kozue,It's easier on you this way. 
Utena,You shouldn't do reckless stuff like that any more. You'll worry your brother.
Kozue,"My my, brother mine, are you worried about me?"
Miki,I said don't lean on me. 
Utena,I left your bags right here. 
Miki,Sorry for making you carry our luggage around.
Anthy,What shall we do with these little ones?
Miki,"Bringing them home with us was all very well and good, but now what?"
Anthy,How about giving them some ground millet for now?
Miki,Millet? 
Anthy,...which is also fed to parakeets and Java sparrows.
Miki,"Oh, that stuff? "
Anthy,Steep it in tepid water and then grind it.
Miki,Right. 
Anthy,"Since they are chicks, you must feed them every three hours during the day."
Miki,"Got it. Wow, that's pretty tough. "
Anthy,"Yes, quite. "
Utena,You don't hear them talk to each other this much very often.
Miki,"Himemiya-san, you must've raised chicks before, right?"
Anthy,No. 
Miki,"Really? You sure know a lot about it. You're really into animals, aren't you?"
Anthy,"Actually, it would be best to return the birds to their parents, but..."
Anthy,"Oh, are you all right standing by yourself? "
Kozue,"Thank you. But since you've come all this way out here,"
Kozue,the cute younger sister will tactfully bow out.
Kozue,Take your time. 
Kozue,"That letter. Is it from ""her""? "
Miki,Yeah. 
Miki,You read it too. 
Miki,It's from our mother. 
Utena,"Wow, that's cool, getting a letter from your mother."
Utena,"I don't have any family, so I'm a bit jealous."
Kozue,We don't need any parents. 
Kozue,"After all, we're wild animals. "
Miki,Quit badmouthing them. Mother and Father are always concerned about us...
Kozue,"Oh dear, I made you get all serious. "
Utena,"Hey, do you think this is ""the"" garden? "
Anthy,Hmm? Which garden? 
Utena,"""The Sunlit Garden"". You know, the title of that song Miki wrote."
Anthy,"I don't know. But that's just an image, right?"
Utena,Didn't Miki say that he and Kozue-chan played piano in a garden when they were little?
Anthy,So he did. 
Utena,I wonder if it was this one? It's pretty desolate.
Anthy,"Well, it's a memory, so... "
Utena,"That's probably true, but I imagined something more..."
Akio,More...what? What did she say? 
Anthy,Well now...I wondered that too. 
Anthy,I haven't a clue. 
Akio,What do you think of her? 
Anthy,What do I think...? 
Akio,What do you think of her. Tell me. 
Anthy,The tea-cup broke. 
Utena,Akio-san! Are you around? 
Akio,"Yeah, right over here. What's up? "
Utena,"Well, nothing special. I- "
Utena,"Um, am I butting in on some brother-sister stuff?"
Akio,"Come now, ""butting in""? "
Akio,Aren't the three of us just like family already?
Akio,You don't have to hesitate at all. 
Utena,Just like family huh? 
Anthy,I'm sorry. My brother said a rather forward thing to you...
Utena,"No, it's okay. "
Utena,"I don't have any family, so it actually made me feel good."
Utena,"It's true. Your brother's really, like, magnaminous."
Anthy,"My brother is...well, let's see. He certainly is mature."
Anthy,He's like a parent to me. 
Utena,Parents... 
Utena,Do you think fathers and mothers always care for their children like Miki said?
Anthy,Could that be because of their genes? 
Utena,That's a pretty harsh thing to say. 
Anthy,I'm sorry. 
Utena,You don't have to apologize. 
Juri,The Ends of the World started sending us letters again.
Miki,"Saionji-senpai hated the Duels that much, but he Dueled again anyway."
Miki,Maybe it's got something to do with that.
Juri,I'm worried about what Touga's up to. 
Nanami,What about my brother? 
Juri,"""Defeat Tenjou Utena, for the sake of you Duelists""...is it?"
Miki,I don't like this! 
Miki,"Most adults who tell you to do things ""for your own sake"" can't be trusted."
Nanami,"That's a motion of no-confidence towards the Ends of the World, isn't it?"
Miki,Interpret it that way if you want. 
Miki,"If Dueling means being manipulated by selfish adults, I'm stopping right now."
Juri,It's too early to be that resolute. 
Juri,The true nature of the Ends of the World is not yet known.
Nanami,"That's right. He might be ""Daddy Long Legs"" for all you know."
Juri,Nanami. Hurry up and let me use that. 
Nanami,No-o-o-o-o-o.... 
Miki,Yeah. It was in the letter from mother. 
Miki,"No, Kozue and I aren't opposed to it. "
Miki,"Father, it's entirely up to you. "
Miki,"I don't think we'll be able to make it to the wedding, but we'll at least send a telegram."
Miki,What? With who? 
Miki,"Oh, don't bother. You mean new mother, right?. Don't worry about that."
Miki,Father? 
Anthy,Don't worry. Calling myself his mother so suddenly would be too shameless.
Nanami,"Well, look who's here! "
Kozue,Same to you. 
Nanami,What're you doing? I heard you were injured.
Kozue,Wild animals heal fast. 
Nanami,"Is that so. Well, that's fine... "
Nanami,..but loitering is prohibited for anybody not on the Student Council.
Kozue,I'm meeting someone. 
Nanami,At this hour? Who on earth? 
Kozue,"A ""Daddy Long Legs"". Shall I introduce you?"
Nanami,No thanks. 
Touga,It's almost dawn. How long do you plan on staying here?
Miki,The school festival is coming up. I'm getting my fingers in shape.
Touga,What are you being indignant for? 
Miki,I'm not being indignant or anything... 
Touga,I hear you plan to quit being a Duelist. 
Miki,Yes. 
Touga,But you've already chosen the path of a Duelist.
Touga,I believe you know that there's something you can't have unless you take it for yourself.
Touga,Reached an impasse? 
Miki,Juri-san said she suspected you've been up to something lately.
Touga,Such a beautiful melody. 
Touga,But it can't sustain that beauty by being beautiful alone.
Touga,"Oh my, it hit the wall already. "
Miki,What are you trying to say? 
Touga,There's someone I want you to meet. 
Miki,Someone you want me to meet? 
Touga,"Listen, can't you hear it? "
Miki,Hear what? 
Touga,If your soul has not truly given up... 
Touga,...you should be able to hear... 
Touga,...the sound... 
Touga,...resounding across the Ends of the World.
Miki,What are you talking about? 
Miki,I hear it! I really hear it! 
Miki,What's going on?! 
Touga,"Now, allow us to invite you, to the world you desire!"
Miki,You're the Chairman of the Board...correct? 
Kozue,Yep. Himemiya-senpai's older brother. 
Miki,What're you doing in a place like this? 
Kozue,It's obvious. I'm on a date with Akio-san. 
Miki,"Oh? Well, whatever. "
Miki,"More importantly, what do you want with me, Mr. Chairman?"
Kozue,"You love Himemiya-senpai, don't you Miki?"
Miki,Hey! 
Kozue,You don't have to be so bashful. 
Kozue,"If she's so important to you, then make her yours."
Kozue,Akio-san said he'd help you. 
Kozue,He's awesome. 
Miki,I thought you hated Himemiya-senpai. 
Kozue,What I want is for you to be happy. 
Miki,"What're you talking about, all of a sudden?"
Kozue,I'm always honest with my feelings. That's all.
Kozue,I don't lie. 
Kozue,Don't you trust me? 
Miki,That's not it... 
Kozue,Akio-san said it's for your own sake. 
Miki,"Well, he's an adult. "
Kozue,So? 
Kozue,"If everything around you is dirty, don't you have no choice but to get dirty too?"
Kozue,You've got no choice but to get dirty and then get what you want.
Miki,What I want... 
Miki,"You're the one who made Saionji-san Duel before, aren't you?"
Miki,"You seduced Touga, and interfered with the Student Council..."
Miki,...what the hell are you...? 
Akio,"I'll show you the Ends of the World. Yes, even you."
Miki,So that's it! You're... 
Kozue,"Hey, be more gentle. "
Miki,Sorry. Is it crooked? 
Kozue,"No, it's okay. Attach it here. "
Miki,Okay. 
Utena,"Hi, you two. Setting up a nest box? "
Utena,I wonder if the parent birds will come back.
Utena,What is it? 
Miki,"Today, after school, at the Arena of Duels."
Utena,No way... 
shadow,"I wonder I wonder, do you know what I wonder?"
shadow,"Honored guest, isn't it about time to quit?"
shadow,"Damn it, I'm betting my entire purse! All of it on black!"
shadow,Are you positive? 
shadow,"Oh, what a shame! It was red! "
shadow,"Honored guest, didn't you said you hated gambling, and had never done it before in your life?"
shadow,Hey! You're the one who recommended I try it at least once!
shadow,Just stay put. I'm gonna withdraw my life savings.
shadow,What a sucker. 
Utena,Kozue-chan! What're you doing dressed like that?
Kozue,Miki. 
Kozue,Ready? Here we go. 
Anthy,Utena-sama. 
Utena,Yeah. 
Anthy,"O roses of noble memory, I beseech thee:"
Anthy,Appear before me. 
both,Grant me the power to Revolutionize the World!
Utena,I thought you and I were already friends! 
Miki,"Your sword can't beat mine, can it? "
Miki,"As of today, the Rose Bride is mine! "
Miki,You've gotten a lot better. But... 
Miki,What? 
Miki,Himemiya-san! 
Kozue,I hear people who get Engaged to you get an amazing power.
Kozue,What kind of amazing power? 
Miki,Kozue! What're you doing?! 
Kozue,Show that power to me. 
Miki,Kozue!! 
Kozue,You'll lose if you don't keep your eyes on what you're doing.
Utena,A child's sword... 
Utena,I wonder what made him Duel me so suddenly? 
Anthy,Who knows. 
Utena,"I mean, Miki's more... "
Anthy,More...what? 
Miki,What?! 
Kozue,Coward.

Utena,"Hey Himemiya, do you worry about things you can't tell other people?"
Anthy,"Sunny-side up, rolled eggs with soup stock, spa egg..."
Utena,I'm sure everybody has embarrassing things they can't talk to others about.
Anthy,"Scrambled eggs, omelettes... "
Utena,I wonder what the heck Nanami's worrying about.
Anthy,"Without breaking the eggshell, an omelette cannot be made."
