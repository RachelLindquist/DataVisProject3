Nanami,H-huh?
Nanami,What is it? 
Touga,"What's up, Nanami? "
Nanami,"Oh, nothing! "
Nanami,Was I dreaming? 
Nanami,An egg. 
Nanami,Don't tell me...that I... 
Nanami,N-no...it couldn't be... 
Nanami,NOOOOOO!!!!! 
title,"""Nanami's Egg"" "
Tsuwabuki,Let's see...apparently third period P.E. has been changed to females-only health ed.
Tsuwabuki,"And regarding today's lunch, what would you like to eat?"
Tsuwabuki,"I thought the same-old same-old would be boring at the cafeteria, so I was thinking of havinga sandwich on the patio..."
Nanami,"Keep calm...keep calm, Nanami! "
Nanami,I've never heard of humans laying eggs before.
Nanami,That's right. This must be somebody's plot to bring about my downfall.
shadow,"Good grief, Nanami-san laid an egg? "
shadow,I can't believe it! 
shadow,Totally! Nanami-san's like some alien child or something.
Nanami,Noooo!! 
Tsuwabuki,"What's wrong, Nanami-san? "
Nanami,"Oh, nothing really... "
Utena,"Geez, I'm sorry Nanami! That went farther than I thought it would..."
Tsuwabuki,"Oh, good morning Tenjou-san. "
Utena,Good morning. 
Nanami,"Hey! Be more careful! What if it got broken?! Broken, you hear!"
Nanami,That's so dangerous! I won't stand for it!
Utena,"""Broken""? Break what? "
Utena,Hey! Break what? 
Nanami,E....err..... 
Nanami,No way...could she be... 
Nanami,The egg...my egg...! 
Utena,"What's this? Hey Nanami, what's up with carrying around that egg?"
Tsuwabuki,"Oh Nanami-san, how could you carry around an egg like that?"
Utena,Don't tell me you laid that yourself? 
Tsuwabuki,"Oh Nanami-san, you actually laid an egg..."
Utena,That means she's an alien! 
Tsuwabuki,Oh Nanami-san... that makes you an alien!
Nanami,Noooo!!! 
Utena,Is she feeling sick or something? 
Tsuwabuki,"No, she's been like this all morning. "
Tsuwabuki,"Nanami-san, are you really okay? "
Tsuwabuki,There's something wrong with you this morning.
Utena,Hmmm...she doesn't seem to have a fever... 
Utena,"Ah, now her temperature's rising! "
Nanami,Shut up!! A friggin' she-male like you would never understand!!
Tsuwabuki,Wait! Nanami-san...! 
Utena,"""She-male""? "
Miki,Hmmm. It certainly is a strange egg. 
Miki,It certainly doesn't seem to be from a bird or a reptile...
Miki,"Moreover, it's a a fresh, just-born-this-morning, newborn egg too."
Nanami,"Fresh, just-born-this-morning? "
Miki,Where'd you get this egg? 
Nanami,"Well, I... "
Miki,What?! You laid this egg? 
Miki,No way... It's impossible. 
Miki,There's no way a human could- that's it!
Miki,"So, Nanami-kun was an alien! I see, I see!"
Nanami,Stop it!!!!!! 
Nanami,I can't say...even to Miki...anything but this...
Miki,What's wrong? 
Nanami,"Hey Micky. What if, just if mind you, a certain girl laid that egg..."
Miki,A girl? 
Nanami,"Yes, a girl. "
Miki,Hmm...what an interesting thing to say. 
Miki,It's true that there are mammals that lay eggs...
Nanami,There are?! 
Miki,"Yeah. But, I've never heard of a girl laying eggs."
Miki,Huh? Nanami-kun? 
Nanami,I had no idea. There really are people in this world who lay eggs...
Nanami,How marvelous! 
Keiko,"Oh, Nanami-sama. "
Yuuko,What're you doing there? 
Eiko,You look kind of pale. 
Nanami,"I swear, you don't know the half of it! I wake up first thing in the morning and what do I find-"
Nanami,Wait a sec. What if I'm the only one who didn't know until now?
Nanami,"Actually, I laid an egg this morning. "
Yuuko,Your first egg? 
Keiko,"What, Nanami-sama, it took you this long?"
Eiko,"You're more behind the times than I thought, Nanami-sama!"
all,Way behind the times! Way behind the times! Nanami-sama is a teru-teru-boozu.
all,"Not only that, she's a space alien! "
Nanami,Oh noooooo!! 
Nanami,I don't care if they come to pick me up. I'm not going back.
Keiko,Nanami-sama? 
Nanami,"Silly me! Nothing's wrong, nothing at all!"
Nanami,I won't have it! I simply won't have it! To think I was the only one who didn't know...
Nanami,Hey! What if the egg breaks?! 
Nanami,Oh great! Why'd I have to bump into Juri of all people?
Nanami,"I just know she's gonna belittle me. Me, who hasn't laid any eggs until now..."
Juri,Nanami. 
Juri,Be more careful. You almost scratched my ball.
Nanami,Ball? 
Juri,Yes. This ball. 
Nanami,Ball? 
Juri,Yes. My ball. 
Nanami,Ball? 
Juri,Ball. 
Nanami,It's huge. 
Juri,Wanna hold it? 
Nanami,S-so heavy! 
Nanami,What is this? Do they all get this big?
Juri,"They didn't used to be that big, but now they're roughly that size."
Nanami,Didn't used to...? 
Juri,When I was seven. 
Nanami,Since that long ago? 
Juri,I've got many more at my house. 
Nanami,M-many more? 
Juri,It feels...pretty good. 
Nanami,Feels good?! 
Juri,You should try it too. Later. 
Nanami,Juri's just so mature... 
Juri,Strike! 
Nanami,"Egg, egg, my little egg, hurry hurry and grow up!"
Nanami,There was nothing to worry about at all.
Nanami,Everybody's laying eggs these days. 
Nanami,Hurry and grow up. I'm your mother. 
Nanami,"Egg, egg, my little egg, hurry hurry and grow up!"
Tsuwabuki,Nanami-san...Nanami-san! 
Nanami,Hmm? What is it? 
Tsuwabuki,Are you okay? 
Nanami,It's just fine. I'm taking good care of it.
Tsuwabuki,"Huh? Nanami-san, if there's anything bothering you, please let me know, okay?"
Tsuwabuki,I'll do anything for your sake. 
Nanami,Oh really...anything? 
Nanami,"Well then, if I told you to run at 300 k.p.h., you'd do it?"
Nanami,"If I said to fly at Mach 5, you'd do it?!"
Nanami,"If I said dive ten thousand meters underwater, you'd do it?!?"
Tsuwabuki,"Um, that is, err... "
Nanami,You can't do it! You can't do it! You can't do any of it!!
Nanami,Don't blab to people about how you can do things you can't!!
Nanami,Hmph! 
Tsuwabuki,Nanami...san? 
Utena,Something's wrong with Nanami? 
Tsuwabuki,Yes. How should I put it... 
Tsuwabuki,"Lately, it seems that she's been really irritable..."
Tsuwabuki,And she's kind of pale...I'm really worried.
Utena,Maybe she's got the maternity blues. 
Anthy,It sounds just like she laid an egg. 
Tsuwabuki,What? An egg? 
Anthy,My pet Nanami has been like that after laying eggs too.
Tsuwabuki,No way... 
Utena,Yeah. I'm sure Nanami'd get really bugged getting confused for a chicken.
Anthy,Really? 
Anthy,But I wonder who the father is. 
Utena,Hey now. 
Nanami,"Egg, egg, my little egg, hurry hurry and grow up!"
Nanami,"Egg, egg, my little egg, hurry hurry and grow up!"
Touga,Nanami. 
Nanami,Brother! 
Touga,You seem to be in a very good mood this morning.
Nanami,I'm doing my best. For the sake of our brightly shining future.
Touga,For our future? 
Nanami,"Brother, which do you prefer, boys, or girls?"
Touga,Isn't it obvious? Girls. 
Nanami,I'm so glad. Me too. 
Touga,You prefer girls? 
Nanami,Yes. 
Touga,"Listen, Nanami. God made both men and women, because that is the most ideal combination."
Touga,"Even if you feel mentally content, opposing the designs of God is-"
Nanami,"Oh, brother, what're you talking about! You're the only one for me."
Touga,"But, you just said you preferred girls... "
Nanami,That's not what I meant! 
Touga,Then what? 
Nanami,"So, what about girls who lay eggs... "
Touga,Nanami. Do you know why we're able to live together happily like this?
Nanami,What? 
Touga,It's because you're not the kind of girl who lays eggs.
Touga,Who I feel sorry for is the family that such a girl betrays.
guy1,Stir stir stir stir stir. 
Nanami,"How could you, brother? You didn't have to put it that way..."
guy2,Stir stir stir stir stir. 
Nanami,"Juri and Keiko and the others are laying eggs, so why shouldn't I?"
guy3,Stir stir stir stir stir. 
Nanami,That's right! What are Keiko and the others doing with the eggs they lay?
Nanami,They wouldn't! 
guys,Stir stir stir stir! 
guys,Slurp slurp slurp. 
guys,Burp! 
Nanami,NOOOOOO!!!!!!! 
shadow,"Now then, gentlemen. Things are only impossible because you think they're impossible."
shadow,Take this egg for instance. I bet you think that eggs can't stand upright.
shadow,"However! If we support it with chopsticks this way, we can..."
shadow,Pardon me! Wouldn't it be faster to simply break the bottom?
shadow,"No, that is not correct! "
shadow,If we support it with chopsticks like so...
shadow,I guess it wasn't an egg. 
Nanami,I'm sorry. I don't have the courage to eat my own egg.
Nanami,Please live here in happiness. 
Nanami,It's been a long time since we ate together.
Nanami,I'm so happy! 
Touga,Nanami. Do you know why we're able to enjoy times like this together?
Nanami,What? 
Touga,It's because you're not the kind of girl who lays eggs.
Nanami,"T-that's right, brother! Of course! "
Nanami,"You did the right thing, Nanami. You did the right thing."
Nanami,I just can't do it. 
Nanami,I just can't! 
Nanami,It's gone. Oh no... 
Nanami,Where did it go? 
Nanami,What's this smell? 
Nanami,What have you done?! 
Saionji,"What have I done? Since there was a fine moon out, I went camping."
Nanami,What have you done?! How could you eat eggs like that!
Nanami,They're eggs I tell you...eggs! 
Saionji,"Ordinarily, eggs are supposed to be eaten."
Nanami,"You brute, brute brute brute brute!! "
Saionji,Hey! Stop that! 
Nanami,Give back my egg... Give it back! 
Saionji,"There are limits to gluttony. If you wanted to eat an egg, you should simply have asked."
Saionji,I've got any number of them right here.
Nanami,Thank goodness! You're all right! 
Saionji,But let me caution you: having an acquaintance who makes such a fuss over an egg is embarrassingin the extreme.
Saionji,Never again display such- 
Saionji,Neither of those siblings has the slightest shred of grace.
Saionji,It burned! 
Nanami,"Egg, egg, my little egg, hurry hurry and grow up!"
Nanami,I'm so sorry. I'll never leave you alone again.
Anthy,Utena-sama. Do you believe in reincarnation? 
Utena,Hmmm. I dunno. 
Anthy,"They say that an elephant, at the end of its lifespan, parts from the herd and dies in solitude."
Utena,"Maybe it doesn't want to make its children sad, and dies alone so no one can say anything."
Anthy,From parent to child...hearts being passed on eternally.
Utena,I see. I guess bequeathing one's heart to one's descendants could be called a form of reincarnation.
Utena,Why are we talking about this? 
sign,Danger 
Nanami,What? This is...this is...my egg? 
Nanami,I'm sorry! I'll never throw you away again!
Nanami,I'll never throw you away again! 
Nanami,My...egg... 
Nanami,A dream? 
Nanami,Noooooo!! 
Utena,"Come to think of it, I haven't seen him recently."
Anthy,He'll be back soon. 
Utena,I hope so... 
Utena,Yes! 
Utena,Chu-Chu! Welcome back!
