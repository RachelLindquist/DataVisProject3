Juri,Feelings I can never put into words.
Juri,But my heart always keeps on whispering. 
Juri,And...you too... 
sign,Tsuchiya Ruka 
Juri,Next! 
Juri,Next! 
Utena,Senpai's really something. This is the eighth opponent in a row.
Anthy,She's so strong. 
Juri,Next! 
Juri,Next! 
Miki,Yes ma'am! 
Ruka,"Sorry for not having an appointment, but would you mind if I was your next opponent?"
Ruka,Sorry. 
Miki,Amazing. He's as good as Juri-senpai is.
Utena,No. Senpai was slightly slower. 
Ruka,"I was wondering how much you'd grown while I was away,"
Ruka,but it looks like I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up.
Juri,"So it really was you, Captain. "
Utena,What?! 
Miki,"""Captain""...? "
Ruka,"Hey hey, you're the captain now, Arisugawa. "
title,Whispering in the Dark 
Juri,Ruka has returned to the Academy. 
Nanami,Ruka has? 
Juri,"Yes. Tsuchiya Ruka, Captain of the Fencing Club."
Miki,"Juri-san, aren't you the Captain of the Fencing Club?"
Juri,I'm just minding things in his absense. 
Miki,I had no idea. 
Nanami,But what the heck is he doing back now?
Ruka,"How cruel, Nanami-kun. "
Ruka,Is that any way to talk to a recovering upperclassman?
Nanami,Ruka-senpai! 
Ruka,"Having long been absent from school due to an illness, I have now returned to school."
Nanami,Congratulations on your good health... 
Ruka,Thank you. 
Ruka,The Ends of the World seems rather displeased. 
Ruka,He complains that none of you have any spine.
Juri,Have you been chosen too? 
Miki,Then you're going after Tenjou-san too? 
Ruka,Hey now. I'm still recovering. 
Nanami,Then what do you intend to do? 
Ruka,"Good question. Well, I haven't been at the Academy for a while."
Ruka,"For now, I think I'll just enjoy the carefree student life."
Nanami,Thanks for the meal... 
Ruka,"No, close your stance more. "
Ruka,Tilt in your hips. 
Ruka,"Yes, that's more like it. "
girl,Okay. 
girl,"Hey, get out of there! I want my turn! "
crowd,Me too! Me too! 
girl,Tsuchiya-san's just so awesome! 
girl,It feels like he's all anyone talks about anymore.

Shiori,U-um...I'm sorry... 
Shiori,"I, um, wasn't trying to... "
Ruka,I see. So it was you. 
Shiori,What...? 
Ruka,"While I was away, somebody polished my sword every day."
Ruka,I was so happy. 
Ruka,"It was you, right? "
Shiori,"Yes. All for your sake, "
Shiori,every day I polished this sword... 
Ruka,Thank you. You're such a gentle person. 
Shiori,"Oh no, I'm not- "
girl,"Hey, check it out! Get a load of those two!"
girls,Whoa! Major shock! 
girl,Shiori's really something! 
girl,I can't believe she got Tsuchiya-san so fast!
girl,She's usually all quiet and stuff... 
girl,...but she really kicks butt when she wants to.
Juri,"I have something to say. Meet me ""there"". "
Ruka,I'm glad you remembered this place. 
Ruka,"Sure takes you back, doesn't it? "
Ruka,I taught you all my techniques here. 
Ruka,"From the moment you entered the club, your talent shone brighter than anyone else."
Juri,You're the Captain of the Fencing Team. I leave the management of the club in your hands.
Ruka,Oh? 
Juri,And whatever you're plotting as a Duelist is none of my concern.
Juri,But... 
Ruka,But? 
Juri,Keep your hands off of Shiori. 
Ruka,What for? 
Juri,Shiori is... 
Juri,Shiori is an old friend of mine. 
Ruka,I see. I understand what you're saying. 
Ruka,But I think you're misunderstanding something.
Juri,What? 
Ruka,I said already that I was going to live the carefree life.
Ruka,Why shouldn't I be free to enjoy romance with anyone in the Academy I want?
Utena,Tsuchiya Ruka. A swordsman good enough to surpass Arisugawa-senpai.
Utena,This amazing person has returned to the Fencing Club.
Anthy,"You seem to be worried, Utena-sama. "
Utena,Yeah. I feel some kind of unease. 
Ruka,You're panting just like a little puppy. 
Shiori,Come on... 
Ruka,"Well, shall we go? "
Ruka,"No matter how long the night is, it'll be just like a second to us."
Shiori,Yes. 
Juri,He knows. 
Juri,He knows everything. 
Shiori,"Oh, Juri-san. "
Shiori,What's that expression for? 
Juri,"Shiori, you shouldn't go out with him. "
Shiori,What? 
Juri,"Your surprise is understandable. But, I'm worried about you."
Juri,You mustn't trust that- 
Shiori,Juri-san. 
Shiori,"You really suck, you know? "
girl,"Shiori, whatcha up to? "
girl,Let's get going already. 
Shiori,"Yeah, coming. "
girl,What's wrong? 
Shiori,"Oh, nothing. "
girl,Isn't Arisugawa-senpai such a scary person?
Shiori,"Oh, really? "
Shiori,Tsuchiya-senpai! 
Touga,Hi. 
Shiori,Who're you... 
Touga,Sorry for startling you. 
Touga,I came with a message from Tsuchiya. 
Touga,He said he'd take you someplace wonderful and he wanted you to wait for him.
Shiori,Someplace wonderful? 
Touga,"Listen, can't you hear it? "
Touga,If your soul has not truly given up... 
Touga,...you should be able to hear... 
Touga,...the sound... 
Touga,...resounding across the Ends of the World.
Shiori,What...are you saying? 
Shiori,What?! What's going on? 
Touga,"Now, allow us to invite you, to the world you desire!"
Ruka,Were you surprised? 
Shiori,"No, not at all. "
Ruka,I thought you'd say that. 
Shiori,"You're gonna take me someplace wonderful, right?"
Ruka,That's right. You've become an adult too.
Ruka,Let's grab hold of the whole world. 
Ruka,Just the two of us. 
Shiori,The whole world... 
Ruka,Yes. The enormous Power of Miracles. 
Shiori,Will that be mine? 
Ruka,Yes. 
Shiori,How wonderful. 
Akio,"Pleasant vibrations, aren't they? "
Utena,Always so pretty... 
Utena,"Um, the roses. "
Ruka,You're Tenjou Utena-kun? 
Ruka,"We've met once before, right? "
Utena,Yes. I saw your match with Arisugawa-senpai. 
Ruka,Yes. 
Ruka,What splendid roses. 
Ruka,Such a nice smell. 
Utena,Are you a Duelist too? 
Ruka,"Today, after school, in the Arena of Duels."
shadow,Can you catch anything? 
shadow,Doesn't look like it. 
shadow,I got one! 
shadow,Hold on tight! Don't let it get away! 
shadow,"Okay, come to papa! "
shadow,"Hey, isn't that a sandal? "
shadow,"Ooh, I got one over here! "
shadow,"Don't lose it, this is for dinner tonight!"
shadow,"Damn, it's a kettle. "
shadow,"Look, they're biting over there too! "
shadow,"Okay, this is the real thing this time!"
shadow,A tire? 
shadow,I guess. 
shadow,Heave! 
Ruka,"If you saw my match with Juri, you should already know."
Ruka,I'm far better with a sword. 
Utena,We'll never know till we try. 
Ruka,"That's correct. You've got hidden powers, and I may not be able to beat them."
Anthy,"O roses of noble memory, I beseech thee:"
Anthy,Appear before me. 
both,Grant me the power to Revolutionize the World!
Ruka,Neither Saionji nor Touga is an amateur. Yet they couldn't beat you.
Ruka,I wonder how we'll do. 
Utena,You're the first person who's ever said that during a Duel.
Ruka,Really? But because I've decided to fight...
Ruka,...I intend to win! 
Ruka,Now! Show me your power! 
Utena,So strong... 
Ruka,Oh? This might be easier than I thought. 
Utena,Say what?! 
Ruka,"Hey now, I'm still recovering. "
Ruka,Be a bit more gentle. 
Ruka,What? Is that it? 
Ruka,"Ah, so that's it. "
Shiori,"Hey, we'll win next time, right? I mean, the Power of Miracles is ours after all."
Shiori,Those two won't- 
Ruka,There is no next time. 
Shiori,What? 
Ruka,"No matter how often we do this, the outcome wouldn't change."
Ruka,It's partially the Bride's fault that I lost.
Shiori,"No way, that's cruel. "
Shiori,Do you know how much I cared about you?
Shiori,That's right! I polished your sword every day!
Shiori,Only for you... 
Ruka,Oh that? That wasn't my sword. 
Ruka,"Your acting was really something. Great, for an ad-lib."
Juri,I thought I told you to keep your hands off Shiori.
Ruka,She chose this herself. 
Juri,Don't say that. 
Ruka,Right. There's no need for me to say it.
Ruka,"After all, you know it better than anybody else."
Juri,Ruka! What're you after! What're you thinking?!
Juri,Ruka!!

Utena,"There's a rumor going around that Arisugawa-senpai loves Shiori-san, but what do you think's going on?"
Anthy,I don't think other people would understand. 
Utena,Huh? 
Anthy,"""Love""...it means different things to different people."
Utena,"No, I wasn't asking something that general. What I wanna know now is..."
