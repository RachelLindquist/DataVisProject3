Shiori,"Believe in miracles, that your wishes come true..."
Ruka,Oh that? That wasn't my sword. 
Ruka,"Your acting was really something. Great, for an ad-lib."
Shiori,Tsuchiya-senpai... 
Shiori,"Believe in miracles, that your wishes... "
Shiori,"Senpai, wait! "
Shiori,"Please, you're the only one for me. "
Shiori,I have nobody but you. 
Ruka,Would you let go of my hand? 
Shiori,"If I lose you, I don't know how I can go on."
Shiori,"So please, believe! "
Ruka,Believe in what? 
Shiori,In what...? 
Ruka,What am I supposed to believe about you?
Shiori,"Senpai, to me you're more than anyone...more than..."
Shiori,Senpai! Senpai!! 
title,Azure Blue Paler Than the Sky 
girl,She's still gone from class today. 
girl,Damn straight! 
girl,"Right, there's no way she can face the others."
girl,It's the talk of the whole school. 
girl,Of course it is. 
girl,"But you know, wasn't that kind of cold of Ruka-senpai?"
girl,Really? Looks to me like that girl was the only one getting worked up.
girl,"Yeah, that's true. "
girls,"Yeah, no doubt. "
girl,"Well, isn't it like both their faults? "
girl,Yeah. 
girl,"Oh, what a mess. "
Juri,Don't forget the trick I just showed you.
girl,Yes ma'am! Thank you very much! 
Juri,Meddling again? That's a bad habit of yours.
Utena,Senpai! Aren't you worried? 
Utena,Shiori-san's in so much pain... 
Juri,It's a problem between the two of them. None of my business.
Juri,"It's none of my business, and I have no intention of sticking my nose in it."
Juri,I don't deserve to. 
Utena,You don't have to put it that way! How can you do nothing when a friend is hurting like that?
Utena,Can't you at least listen to what she has to say? Senpai!
Juri,"Don't make me repeat myself, understand? "
Utena,Arisugawa-senpai looked like she was stressing herself out.
Utena,I just can't understand how she could say it's none of her business when Shiori-san was in trouble likethat.
Utena,I wonder if that's how senpai really feels.
Anthy,That could be part of how Juri-san really feels.
Utena,"""Part of how she feels""? That's kind of a weird thing to say."
Anthy,People occasionally say or do things they could never even imagine saying or doing.
Utena,Does that include you too? 
Anthy,"Utena-sama, actually, I... "
Utena,What? 
Anthy,Nothing. 
machine,This is Tsuchiya. I'm out. Leave a message.
Shiori,"You're there, aren't you. I know. "
Shiori,What's wrong with at least listening to me?
Touga,"Looks like you weren't as good as you said you were, either."
Ruka,True. But I figured as much. 
Touga,Say what? 
Ruka,Tenjou Utena is a terrifying opponent. 
Ruka,Someone of my talent is no match for her.
Ruka,But I've got my reasons for having to win no matter what.
Touga,"Did you ""figure"" that too? "
Ruka,"""There are no miracles"". A saying of hers."
Shiori,"Juri-san, so it's you. "
Shiori,What do you want? 
Juri,Shiori... 
Shiori,"You came to laugh at me and feel all superior, didn't you?!"
Juri,Of course not- 
Shiori,You suck worse and worse every day! Did you expect me to cry for help on your shoulder?!
Shiori,"Too bad, but I'm not gonna do what you want me to."
girl,Thank you very much! 
Ruka,Are you serious? 
Juri,Of course. 
Ruka,"What a surprise. Just a little bit ago you were telling me to keep my hands off,..."
Ruka,...and now you're telling me to make up with her.
Juri,If that's what makes her happy. 
Ruka,"Sorry, but I can't grant your request. "
Juri,Ruka! 
Ruka,Your friendship for her impresses me. 
Ruka,"But she's selfish, pushy, and self-centered, and a liar on top of that."
Ruka,"Sorry, but who the hell would want someone like that?"
Juri,"You bastard, who the hell do you think you are?!"
Ruka,Don't try to dictate what I do. 
Juri,Who gave you the right to torment her? 
Ruka,It's none of your business. 
Juri,What kind of mean-spirited asshole have you become?
Ruka,And what makes you think you can tell others what to do?
Ruka,But how about this instead? 
Ruka,I was thinking about going out with you next.
Juri,Who the fuck would go out with you?! 
Ruka,"Don't you actually love me, the Captain of the Fencing Club?"
Juri,You bastard! You've insulted me enough! 
Ruka,Don't hold back now. 
Juri,Who's hol- 
Juri,When did you-? 
Juri,Sto...stop it! Ruka! 
Ruka,I've changed my mind. I'll do what you said.
Ruka,I'll make up with her. 
Ruka,Do you hate me so much you can't stand it any more?
Juri,Wait. 
Juri,"Ruka, duel me. "
Juri,"If I lose, I'll do whatever the hell you want me to."
Juri,"But if I win, Shiori- "
Ruka,I got it. Say no more. 
Ruka,"Ever since you entered the Fencing Club, you were the star pupil."
Ruka,"No matter what surrounded you, you never lost your brilliance."
Ruka,Your talent is vastly greater than mine. 
Juri,You're exaggerating. 
Ruka,Am I? 
Ruka,There's someone I want you to meet. 
Ruka,"Listen, can't you hear it? "
Ruka,If your soul has not truly given up... 
Ruka,...you should be able to hear... 
Ruka,...the sound... 
Ruka,...resounding across the Ends of the World.
Juri,What's that sound?! 
Ruka,"Sorry to keep you waiting, Touga. Your line."
Touga,"Now, allow us to invite you, to the world you desire!"
Ruka,"Now, get in. You said you'd do whatever I told you."
Juri,Where do you intend to take me? 
playback,"Tsuchiya-senpai, I have no one but you."
playback,"Tsuchiya-senpai, I have no one but you."
Juri,Do you enjoy hurting her that much? 
Ruka,"If we raise your latent abilities to their maximum, nobody could beat you."
Ruka,I'm the one who brings out your abilities. 
Ruka,Our combination can beat Tenjou Utena...and obtain the Power of Miracles.
Juri,Did you corner Shiori and I this much just for that?
Ruka,A sacrifice must be made for a miracle to occur.
Juri,That's not fair! Do you want the Power of Miracles that badly?!
Ruka,You're the one who wants the Power of Miracles!
Juri,Shiori isn't some fucking tool of yours! 
Ruka,"""Believe in miracles, that your wishes come true""...aren't those your words?"
Juri,You're misunderstanding something. I don't care if my wishes don't come true.
Juri,"And even if I obtained the Power of Miracles, the only thing I'd wish for..."
Juri,...is freeing her from you. That's all. 
Juri,I'm not letting you get your way any more.
Juri,"And to see that you don't, I'll even take you up on your proposition."
Ruka,"So, we have a deal. "
Akio,"I'll show you the Ends of the World. Yes, even you two."
Utena,Arisugawa-senpai...you too? 
Juri,"After school, at the Arena of Duels. "
Utena,Senpai! 
Ruka,"This time it's the main event, Tenjou Utena-kun."
Juri,Do it. 
Anthy,"O roses of noble memory, I beseech thee:"
Anthy,Appear before me. 
both,Grant me the power to Revolutionize the World!
Ruka,Hidden wishes... 
Ruka,How painful they must be. 
Ruka,"What're you waiting for, Juri?! "
Ruka,"Juri, she's a fool. "
Ruka,Because she doesn't realize that her miracle is standing atop someone else's sacrifice.
Ruka,But that's the sort of person who receives miracles!
Ruka,"Unfair, isn't it! Juri!! "
Ruka,Juri! 
Utena,"Why, senpai? "
Ruka,"Juri, don't worry. "
Ruka,"Don't worry, Juri. "
Juri,"""Don't worry""....huh? "
Nanami,"Oh, so Juri's back to being Captain? "
Miki,Yeah. Tsuchiya-senpai hasn't been coming to school these days.
Nanami,"Oh really? What a shame, and after he recovered and everything."
Nanami,"Well, don't blame me if he gets expelled for poor attendance."
Miki,"Hey, it looks like that girl got hurt. "
Nanami,Well there's nothing to worry about with Juri in charge.
girl,I'm so sorry...and with a local meet coming up and all...
Juri,Don't worry. Just concentrate on healing that leg.
girl,I'm really sorry for causing trouble at a time like this.
shadow,"Hey, do you know? "
shadow,Hmm? 
shadow,That patient died yesterday. 
shadow,He was such a babe too! What a shame. 
shadow,And after he kept saying he wanted to fence again after leaving the hospital.
shadow,It seems he knew how sick he was. But he forced his way out of the hospital anyway and went backto school.
shadow,I bet there's somebody he loved in the Fencing Club.
shadow,"Come to think of it, he was always saying:"
shadow,"""I want to give the Power of Miracles to the one I love. I want to free her."""
shadow,"What's that supposed to mean, I wonder? "
shadow,Who knows... 
Juri,Are you doing well? The next time we meet...
Juri,...there's one thing I really want to ask.
Juri,What hopes had you entrusted to the Power of Miracles?
Juri,And who were they for? 
Juri,I pray that they come true.

Anthy,"What's wrong, Utena-sama? "
Utena,I guess there really are people you mustn't fall in love with.
Anthy,"Well, I don't really know. "
Anthy,But I think there's a part of love that you can't do anything about.
Utena,"Really... come to think of it, do you have somebody you love?"
Anthy,Yes. Someone very special to me. 
Utena,Next time on Shoujo Kakumei Utena:
