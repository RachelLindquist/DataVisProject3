Narrator,Once upon a time... 
Narrator,...there was a princess grieving over the deaths of her mother and father.
Narrator,Before this princess appeared a prince traveling upon a white horse.
Narrator,"His appearance gallant and his smile gentle,"
Narrator,the prince enveloped the princess in the scent of roses and wiped away her tears.
Prince,"""Little lass bearing up alone under grief,"
Prince,"please lose not thy strength and nobility when thou growest up."""
Prince,"""As a token of this day, please retain this."""
Princess,"""Pray, shall we meet once more?"" "
Prince,"""This ring will guide thee to me."" "
Narrator,Was the ring from the prince meant as an engagement ring?
Narrator,"That part was good, "
Narrator,"but because of the strength of her adoration for the prince,"
Narrator,the princess made up her mind to become a prince herself!
Narrator,But is that really good for her? 
Title,On the Night of the Ball 
Utena,And I still have this ring here. 
Utena,So that encounter was real. 
Utena,"The Duel Arena, the Rose Bride... "
Utena,Did this ring guide me to all of that? 
Anthy,"Good morning, Utena-sama. "
Utena,I'm finished. 
Utena,Will we always have to have breakfast and dinner by ourselves like this?
Anthy,It's nice and quiet. 
Utena,You're... 
Anthy,Yes? 
Utena,"You're always by yourself in class, but do you really not have any friends?"
Anthy,"I do, right here. "
Utena,"Well, besides him... "
Utena,"Stop calling me ""Utena-sama,"" will you? "
Anthy,I shouldn't? 
girl,It's Utena-sama! 
girl,"Good morning, Utena-sama! "
Utena,"Hi, morning! "
girl,Utena-sama! 
girl,Good Morning! 
Utena,Morning! 
girl,'Morning! 
Utena,"I know, they call me Utena-sama, but... "
Utena,"when you say it, it doesn't sound like a joke."
Anthy,"But I've been engaged to you, Utena-sama. "
Utena,"I've told you to stop mentioning stuff like ""engagement"" and the ""Rose Bride."""
Anthy,Nevertheless... 
Utena,"Look, no matter how you look at me, I'm a regular wholesome girl."
Utena,"I'm only interested in wholesome boys, not a bride or stuff like that."
Touga,"Well, that's a relief. "
Touga,Hello! 
Touga,"I'm Kiryuu Touga, Student Council President, and a wholesome boy."
Anthy,Good morning. 
Utena,Are you two close? 
Touga,"Oh, definitely. "
Touga,"After all, she is the Rose Bride. "
Utena,I see. You're one of those Duel game freaks.
Touga,Have you mentioned it to anyone? 
Utena,Who'd try to tell anyone about a stupid thing like that?
Touga,Excellent. 
Touga,"Well, you look gallant and beautiful even when you're angry,"
Touga,...Tenjou... Utena-kun. 
Utena,"Don't get too fresh with me, Mr. President. "
Touga,Take it easy. Let's be good friends. 
Touga,"You and I... aren't total strangers, after all."
Utena,Why... Why do you have that? 
Touga,"Just so I could meet you, of course. "
Utena,He couldn't be...? 
Touga,I'd like us to be really good friends. 
Utena,He couldn't be...? 
touga,"If the egg's shell does not break, the chick will die without being born."
touga,We are the chick; the egg is the world. 
touga,"If the world's shell does not break, we will die without being born."
touga,Break the world's shell! 
"touga,juri",For the sake of revolutionizing the world!
Touga,"Yesterday, Saionji fought Tenjou Utena for the second time, and was defeated."
Miki,I've heard he's locked himself in his room since yesterday and hasn't come to school.
Juri,I could care less about him. 
Juri,But Tenjou Utena... Is she trying to revolutionize the world like we are?
Touga,No. 
Touga,"Unlike us, she doesn't seem to receive the letters from the Ends of the World."
Juri,"If not, why does she bear the Rose Signet? "
Touga,"Why, indeed? "
Wakaba,UUUUUUTENA! 
Wakaba,Utena! Utena! Utena-sama! 
Utena,Wakaba... That was very close... 
Wakaba,Was it? 
Wakaba,"Oh, you were watching Touga-san! "
Wakaba,"A-ha, I see... "
Utena,You see what? 
Wakaba,But you should give up on him. 
Utena,What? 
Wakaba,"The rumor is that he's the biggest playboy in our academy, and he's reduced a lot of girls to tears."
Utena,Such a playboy would never be a prince on a white horse...
Wakaba,"By the way, who'd you get for a roommate? "
Utena,Himemiya Anthy. 
Wakaba,Really? 
Wakaba,You got stuck with a lemon. 
Utena,"By a lemon, you mean...? "
Wakaba,"She's actually more popular among guys than she might seem, and I've heard bad rumors about her."
Utena,Rumors? 
girl,It's your fault! You snared our Saionji-san and turned him into a loser!
girl,"He's been away from the Kendo Club, too! "
girl,What a dreadful girl! 
girl,Give us back our Saionji-san! 
girl,Say something! 
Nanami,What's going on here? 
girl,Nanami-sama! 
Nanami,"Pray tell, what is all this commotion? "
Nanami,"Given the circumstances, I'll have to report it to the Student Council."
girl,"Well, uh... "
girl,It's not what it seems. 
girl,Excuse us! 
Nanami,Are you alright? 
Anthy,"Yes, thank you. You're... Nanami-san, they said it was?"
Nanami,"Since you're so popular among the boys, you tend to make people jealous."
Nanami,You're the most popular girl among the boys in my 7th grade class.
Nanami,"At any rate, you've been nominated for the Queen of the Ball this year."
Anthy,Queen of the Ball? 
Nanami,"This weekend, we will choose the Queen of this year's Ball, and you've been nominated."
Nanami,You should come. It'll make the boys happy.
Nanami,"And besides, I've always wanted to be your friend, too, Himemiya-sempai."
Anthy,"Oh, no! You trapped me! "
Utena,"Say, Himemiya... "
Anthy,Yes? 
Utena,You really don't have any friends? 
Anthy,"I do, right here. "
Utena,"Well, besides him, okay? "
boy,"Himemiya Anthy-sama, Tenjou Utena-sama, I have deliveries for you."
boy,"On behalf of the executive committee, I present this dress to you as proof of your nomination for Queenof the Ball."
boy,"We, the executive committee, heartily hope that you will attend the ball wearing this dress this weekend."
Utena,That's awesome. 
Anthy,"What's yours, Utena-sama? "
boy,"And, this box is for Utena-sama from President Kiryuu."
Utena,What? For me? But I have nothing to do with it. I'm not invited.
boy,There should be an invitation and a message card in the box.
boy,"Then, if you will excuse me... "
Utena,Yuck! What the heck is this? 
Utena,Does he think I'll go to the party wearing something like THIS?
Anthy,You're not going? 
Utena,Nope. Not interested. 
Anthy,"Then, neither will I. "
Utena,"How come? You're nominated for Queen of the Ball, aren't you?"
Anthy,But I feel it's hard for me to deal with a place where there are so many people.
Anthy,"Somehow, they all start to look the same, and that frightens me."
Anthy,"Now, it's your turn, Chuchu. "
Utena,"Well, YOU should go. You OUGHT to go! You need friends!"
Utena,"Well, you count, but... You should make a lot more friends!"
Anthy,"If you insist, Utena-sama. "
card,On the night of the Ball --- Kiryuu Touga 
Utena,What in the world is he thinking anyway? 
A-ko,"I wonder, I wonder... do you know what I wonder?"
B-ko:," Ma'am, did you know... "
B-ko,...the whole town is talking about the upcoming ball?
A-ko,"Calling it a ""ball"" sounds nice enough, but it's really just a place for hunting boys."
B-ko,Young ladies today are so low. 
A-ko&B-ko,How shameless! 
Nanami,Guess who? 
Touga,"Stop it, Nanami. "
Nanami,"It's such a lovely evening, isn't it? Onii-sama..."
Touga,"You're such a baby, little sister. "
MC,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this evening's Ball."
MC,We hold this Ball to celebrate a lovely spring evening with nature's blessings.
MC,We also have a contest to choose the Queen of the Ball.
MC,We beg you for your cooperation. 
girl,Utena-sama came in drag!? 
girl,How cute! 
girl,"She looks gallant in a guy's uniform, but she looks perfect in a dress, too!"
girl,"Lovely, Utena-sama! "
Nanami,"How do you like it? Since you're always talking about Himemiya-san lately, I've gone ahead and invited her."
Touga,Tenjou... Utena. 
Utena,I knew I shouldn't have worn this. 
Anthy,"I'm sorry, Utena-sama. "
Anthy,You look like you're embarrassing yourself in it for me.
Utena,"""Embarrassing?"" Really? "
Nanami,"It's so nice to have you here, Himemiya-sempai. "
Anthy,Nanami-san. 
Nanami,This dress looks really wonderful on you.
Anthy,Thank you. 
Nanami,"Since you're nominated, please come this way."
Utena,"A-ha, Himemiya does have a friend. "
Utena,"Well, besides you, of course. "
Touga,Wonderful! 
Touga,Even better than I imagined! 
Utena,"I don't know what you imagined, but this kind of thing doesn't suit me."
Touga,What are you saying? YOU are the true queen of our academy!
Touga,I'd be glad if I could have a dance with you in that dress.
Touga,I think we'd make a photogenic couple. 
girl,"Nanami-sama, she's come wearing the dress we sent her."
girl,It really suits her. 
Nanami,I will humiliate anyone who tries to steal my brother away from me.
Waiter,"Oh, I apologize, miss! "
Anthy,It's all right. 
Nanami,"My, my... You soaked the special dress which I so graciously sent you."
Nanami,It has a little problem when it gets wet.
Touga,"So, let's dance. "
Utena,Hold on there. 
Utena,"First off, this isn't my kind of party. "
Touga,"If not, why did you come? "
Utena,'Cause... 
Touga,'Cause...? 
Utena,You might be... 
Touga,I might be... what? 
Utena,Himemiya! 
Touga,Is this Nanami's doing? 
Touga,"What is she up to? Right when things were getting good, too..."
Utena,Himemiya! 
Nanami,What's that? 
Anthy,Utena-sama! 
Utena,"Let's dance, Himemiya! "
Nanami,And everything was going according to plan... Who IS that girl?
Touga,Nanami! 
Touga,Don't carry your mischief too far. 
Nanami,Whatever do you mean? 
Nanami,"By the way, who's that girl dancing with Himemiya-san?"
Touga,She's Tenjou Utena. 
Nanami,Tenjou Utena... 
Touga,"Yeah, she's something else. "
Touga,But how could she throw away the dress I sent her?
Nanami,My brother gave her a dress? 
Nanami,HER?!
