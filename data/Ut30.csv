guy,"Well like, I said it was my first kiss, but she just ran away."
Wakaba,Saying it's your first kiss is pretty shameless.
guy,But saying it's your first makes a better impression.
Wakaba,"Look, people see right through that kind of lie."
Wakaba,All it does is get her to start not trusting you.
Utena,"First kiss, huh? "
Utena,I wonder if that's what that was. 
title,The Barefoot Girl 
Akio,"I don't know if they came out well, but..."
Utena,"Wow! Akio-san, you really can do everything can't you."
Akio,Shouldn't you praise me after you try it?
Utena,"But like, guys who can bake cakes are way rare."
Anthy,Coming! 
Wakaba,Hi! I'm Shinohara Wakaba! 
Utena,Such great timing she has... 
Wakaba,Did Akio-san bake this cake? 
Akio,Please help yourself. I can't guarantee how it'll taste.
Wakaba,"Wow! Akio-san, you really can do everything can't you."
Utena,I just said that. 
Akio,Please don't praise me until after you've tasted it.
Wakaba,"But like, guys who can bake cakes are way rare."
Utena,I just said that too. 
Wakaba,Party-pooper. 
Utena,"Look, Akio-san's already got a fiancee. "
Wakaba,"Hey, that doesn't matter where love's concerned."
Utena,Yeah right. 
Akio,What're we talking about? 
Utena,Nothing. 
Wakaba,"Oh, nothing at all! "
Akio,Working on your feminine wiles? 
Utena,"Oh, 'course not. "
Wakaba,Utena. 
Wakaba,If you keep being so uptight... 
teacher,...you'll never fall in love. 
teacher,Behave more like a girl! I'm saying this for your sake.
teacher,Wearing boy's clothing isn't the slightest bit attractive.
Utena,"But you know, everyone says this style's pretty hip."
teacher,"What's this ""everyone says""? All that matters is good sense that I decide as guidance counselor!"
Utena,"Yeah, but... "
teacher,"Vice Principal, please tell her straight off."
teacher,"You must abide by the rules. Girls should wear nice, fluttering skirts."
Utena,Who thought that one up? 
Akio,What seems to be the problem? 
teacher,"Oh my, Mr. Chairman. "
Utena,Akio-san. 
teacher,"What do you mean, ""Akio-san""?! "
Utena,"Well, um, I... "
Akio,Vice Principal. 
teacher,Yes sir. 
Akio,I'd like to attend tonight's Middle School staff social.
teacher,"Oh my my my, I've always wanted rub shoulders and chat with the Chairman of the Board."
teacher,"So, Mr. Chairman, err...regarding the members of the inspection team of our sister campus in Amsterdam..."
Akio,Ah yes. The formal announcement from the selection committee may come out any day now.
teacher,"I was wondering if, by any chance, you could perhaps mention my name..."
Akio,I'll keep that in mind. 
Akio,"Now, I have some business with this girl. I'm borrowing her."
teacher,"How fabulous...the Chairman's looks, and fashion..."
Akio,"Oh, and take care not to constrict the students too much with the rules."
Akio,I'm counting on you to offer guidance that maximizes the student's independence.
Utena,Umm... 
Utena,"What ""business"" did you have with me? "
Akio,You dummy. I don't have any such thing. 
Akio,I'm a fan of that valiant style of yours too.
Utena,It's not that great... 
Akio,"Besides, seeing you standing up for your beliefs against those nagging teachers..."
Akio,"...seemed somehow strong, and noble to me."
Utena,Are you sure the Chairman of the Board should be saying things like that?
Akio,"Who cares? After all, you're my sister's - no, my close friend."
Utena,Really. 
Akio,Let's go. 
Utena,Dummy! What're you thinking. He's already got a...
Utena,"Hey, I've been seeing that car around a lot lately."
Akio,It's a popular model this year. 
Akio,Don't you like it? 
Utena,"No, that's not it... "
Wakaba,U-te-na... 
Utena,Wakaba. 
Akio,"Hello, Shinohara-san. "
Wakaba,"Hi there! Um, could you call me ""Wakaba"" instead of ""Shinohara-san""?"
Wakaba,"Hey, what's with sneaking out here all alone with him? Gettin' pretty involved, aren't we?"
Wakaba,You about to go on a date or something? 
Utena,Of course not. We're just bumped into each other.
Wakaba,Really? 
Utena,Really. 
Wakaba,Really really? 
Utena,Damn straight! 
Wakaba,"In that case, Akio-san, could I go driving with you?"
Utena,Hey now. 
Wakaba,I'm sure meeting you like this today must be fate or something.
Utena,You've been coming over to play every day.
Wakaba,Pretty please with sugar on top! I'll remember it my whole life!
Akio,"Well, let's see. If around two hours is alright, I think I can spend time with you."
Wakaba,Yes!! 
Utena,"Man, talk about pushy. "
Wakaba,"Uh-uh, you stay here. "
Utena,How come? 
Wakaba,Cause...a date is something two people do by themselves.
Wakaba,"Right, Akio-san? "
Utena,Oh really. 
Utena,"Well, later. "
Wakaba,See ya. 
Wakaba,Ba-ha-hi! 
Utena,Ba-ha-hi! 
Wakaba,"Ah, what a nice memory. "
Utena,"Oh, really. "
Wakaba,"The ocean was so pretty, the breeze felt so good..."
Wakaba,It was the bestest possible date. 
Utena,Yeah yeah. 
Utena,"Anyways, I think you know already, but Akio-san's-"
Wakaba,"Already got a fiancee, right? "
Wakaba,And here I was in such a good mood and stuff.
Wakaba,It was just a drive. Nothing more. 
Utena,You sure about that? 
Wakaba,"Ah ha, well look who's jealous! "
Utena,No way in hell! 
Anthy,Good morning. 
Wakaba,Morning! 
Utena,"Oh, good morning, Himemiya... "
Anthy,"Good morning, Utena-sama. "
Utena,It couldn't be. 
Utena,It just couldn't be. 
Utena,Who I love is my Prince... 
Utena,Nobody but the Prince who gave me this ring...
Utena,Why am I this... 
Utena,Why? WHY? 
Utena,Why is my heart pounding this hard? 
Utena,A..ki...o....san... 
guy,Tenjou! 
guy,You alright? 
Utena,"Yeah, nothing major. "
guy,But what's up messing up like that? It ain't like you.
Utena,Sorry 'bout that. 
guy,"Watch out, okay? "
Utena,Sure. 
Utena,Something's definitely wrong with me. 
Utena,Ow... 
Anthy,"Are you okay, Utena-sama? "
Utena,Sort of... Sorry for the trouble. 
Anthy,Not at all. But why don't we go put some ice on it in the infirmary?
Utena,"Say, Himemiya? "
Anthy,Yes? 
Utena,You and I... 
Anthy,Hmm? 
Utena,Akio-san. 
Anthy,"Brother, Utena-sama is... "
Akio,What's wrong? 
Akio,"Now, hop in. You should have that looked at properly at the hospital."
Utena,Sorry about this. 
Akio,Take care of things here. 
Anthy,Okay. 
Utena,Why can't Himemiya ride too? 
Akio,Uh-uh. 
Akio,A date is something two people do by themselves.
Akio,Your best friend taught me that. Am I wrong?
Akio,"Later, Anthy. "
Anthy,"Farewell, brother. "
Anthy,Ba-ha-hi! 
Utena,"Um, Akio-san? "
Akio,Hmm? 
Utena,"I'm really sorry about all of this, making you go all the way to the hospital and all."
Akio,Don't worry so much. We're already just like family aren't we?
Utena,Yes. 
Utena,Ummm.... 
Akio,Hmm? 
Utena,"The ceremony's next spring, right? "
Utena,Kanae-san's such a wonderful person. 
Akio,True. 
Akio,"Well, here we are. "
Utena,Thank you. 
Akio,Does it hurt? 
Utena,I-I'm just fine. 
Akio,"The doctor said you shouldn't walk around today, right?"
Utena,"Wha-? No, I'm fine. I can walk. "
Akio,You shouldn't force yourself. I'll carry you.
Utena,"You're a playboy, aren't you? "
Akio,Why? 
Utena,"I mean, you seem really good at making women feel good."
Akio,Really? 
Utena,"You're sort of, not very Chairman-like, or maybe...kind of bad."
Akio,"Well, you don't do what people tell you, and go around wearing guy's clothes."
Akio,We may just be two of a kind. 
Utena,But I'm doing it because of my Prince. 
Akio,Prince? 
Utena,I want to meet this Prince I loved in my past...and so...
Akio,I'll carry you on my back. Or would you prefer in my arms?
shadow,"Those shoes, those shoes, those shoes! "
shadow,Throw out those shoes at once! 
shadow,Why should I do that to my precious red shoes?
shadow,If you wear those you'll have to go on dancing until you die!
shadow,There are things...one does...even if one knows...they're wrong!
shadow,After all...don't you have...the same red shoes...as mine?
shadow,"I own them, that's all. I'll never put them on."
shadow,"You won't put them on, but you have them."
shadow,"You have them, but you won't put them on, fool."
shadow,Your life's too short for that!

Anthy,Utena-sama... 
Utena,Yes? 
Anthy,Aren't you hungry? 
Utena,Why? 
Anthy,It didn't look like you touched most of your dinner.
Utena,Oh. I wasn't that hungry. 
Utena,"See, about Wakaba. "
Anthy,Yes? 
Utena,"Wakaba said a while ago that there's no such thing as a ""wrong"" love."
Utena,That love wasn't something you can control.
Utena,"But there really are people you mustn't fall in love with, aren't there."
Anthy,I don't know much about that. 
Anthy,"But, I think that just like Wakaba-san said, ""love"" has a part of it that you can't control."
Utena,You really think so? 
Utena,"Come to think of it, do you have anybody you love?"
Anthy,"Yes, I do. A Prince. "
Touga,"Well my goodness. Tenjou Utena, is it?"
Touga,The owner of the glass slipper... 
Akio,"That's right. You've fallen for her, haven't you?"
Touga,Yeah. 
Touga,It sure was a shock losing that Duel to her.
Touga,"No, it wasn't losing the duel, it was realizing there was a girl who could shake my way of thinking."
Touga,That was the first time anything's ever made me reconsider how I've led my life.
Akio,You've got good eyes. She'll be a good woman.
Touga,"That's right, Mr. Chairman. "
Akio,Utena-san? 
Akio,You also didn't eat very much yesterday...are you feeling ill?
Utena,"No, um... "
Akio,What's the matter? 
Utena,"Yeah, ""what's the matter"" indeed? "
Akio,Kanae-san. How unusual to see you at this hour.
Kanae,"I can't catch you except at this time, can I?"
Akio,Really? 
Kanae,Really! 
Akio,I've been busy lately. 
Kanae,Busy stargazing? 
Anthy,"Good morning, Kanae-san. "
Kanae,"Good morning, Anthy-chan. "
Kanae,"I swear, when will you ever call me ""sister""."
Kanae,"Oh, you're...Utena-san, right? "
Utena,Good...morning. 
Akio,Some breakfast? 
Kanae,No thanks. 
Kanae,"Besides, my mother's here. "
Akio,Your mother? 
mother,"It's been a while, Akio-san. "
Akio,"Mother, what brings you here? "
mother,I have something to discuss with you. 
Akio,Regarding what matter? 
Akio,I believe the performance of my duties is proceeding without incident.
Akio,Could it be something that cannot be discussed over the phone?
mother,"Akio-san...have you been avoiding my daughter, Kanae?"
mother,Your position at this school is based on your getting married to my daughter.
mother,And don't forget that engagements can be canceled at any time.
Akio,I'm being good to Kanae-san. So much that I'm thinking of naming a comet after her when I find one.
Akio,Besides. Look. This is Kanae-san's favorite fragrance.
Akio,"I'm always wearing the cologne Kanae-san likes, and when we're all alone together..."
Akio,And how is the real Chairman doing? 
mother,Who cares about that man. 
mother,You. You're my only Prince. 
Wakaba,"Hey hey, Utena! I finally saw Akio's fiancee, Ohtori Kanae."
Wakaba,"She's so wonderful. Beautiful, and smart-looking, plus she's a rich girl..."
Wakaba,I guess it feels like I just can't win...or whatever.
Utena,No. 
Utena,I'm in love with my Prince!

Utena,"Himemiya, you're type-AB, right? "
Utena,"Let's see, elusive and seldom reveal their true feelings huh?"
Anthy,"And you're type-B, right Utena-sama? "
Anthy,Type-B's are self-centered and prone to misconception...
Utena,"Yeah, sorry okay. "
Utena,"By the way, how come Nanami's staying in our room?"
Anthy,Because Nanami-san's a type-B.
