voice,Once upon a time...
voice,...there was a princess grieving over the deaths of her mother and father.
voice,Before this princess appeared a prince traveling upon a white horse.
voice,"His appearance gallant, and his smile gentle, the prince enveloped the princess"
voice,"in the scent of roses, and wiped away her tears."
voice,"""Little one bearing up alone under grief, please lose not thy strength and nobility when thou growestup."""
voice,"""As a token of this day, please retain this."""
voice,"""Pray, shall we meet once more?"" "
voice,"""This ring should guide thee to me."" "
voice,Was the ring from the prince meant as an engagement ring?
voice,"That part was good, "
voice,"but because of the strength of her admiration for the prince,"
voice,the princess made up her mind to become a prince herself!
voice,But is that really good for her? 
text,Her Tragedy 
Nanami,"Yes, this is the Kiryuu residence. "
Nanami,"If you want my brother, he's out right now."
Nanami,If you're in a hurry why don't you try calling his cel phone.
Nanami,"Oh, you don't know it? Well that won't work then."
Nanami,I can tell him for you if you want. 
Nanami,What matter is this- 
Nanami,What a stupid girl. I'm not like you all.
Nanami,My brother and I are siblings. We're blood relations.
Touga,"Hello? Oh, it's you. "
Touga,"Yeah. No, that's not it. Yeah. "
Touga,Of course I wouldn't go out with that girl. Yeah.
Touga,My cel phone was out for repairs. Really. 
Touga,Of course not...I wouldn't turn it off when you might call.
Touga,"You're the only one, baby. "
Nanami,"Wow, what a surprise! "
Nanami,It says here that matches between type B people are the worst.
Nanami,"That's gotta be a lie, right? "
Nanami,"Our father's B, our mother's B, I'm B - we're a type-B family."
Nanami,But it says that we're incompatible- 
Touga,Not interested. 
Nanami,Where're you going? 
Touga,The shower. Wanna come with me? 
Touga,Just kidding. 
Nanami,We used to do everything together. 
Nanami,"Eat, and sleep, and bathe... "
Nanami,But now my brother won't pay any attention to me at all.
Nanami,Must siblings have to grow apart like this?
Touga,[indistinctly] Hold on a second... 
girl,Touga? Where are you? It's so boring cause there's noone but girls here.
girl,"Hey, wanna come over now? "
girl,How come you aren't saying anything? 
girl,"A-ha, I bet there's a girl there, isn't there?"
Nanami,There is. 
girl,"Hey, wait...who're you? "
Nanami,Weren't you told the new number? Poor thing.
Nanami,Maybe you got dumped. 
girl,"Touga-san, why didn't you come to me yesterday?"
girl,I waited all the way until morning. 
girl,All the food I made for you went to waste...
girl,"No, that doesn't matter. Do you hate me?"
girl,Say something. 
girl,"Hey, please. Let me hear your voice. "
Nanami,You dummy. He dumped you. 
Keiko,Type-B people make the absolute worst mates.
Aiko,What type're you? 
Keiko,B. 
Aiko,That prediction's really right on. 
Keiko,"Nanami-sama, what blood type was Touga-sama again?"
Keiko,Nanami-sama? 
Nanami,What're you gonna do after you predict? 
Nanami,Oniisama is mine. I won't let anybody have him.
Nanami,Not anybody... 
Touga,How about tonight? Dinner or something... 
Utena,"You never learn, do you? There's no way I'd do that."
Touga,It's rude not to invite a girl to dinner. 
Anthy,"That's an Italian proverb, isn't it? "
Utena,"Mr. President, are you from a Latin family?"
Touga,Do I look like it? 
Utena,You don't not look like it... 
Nanami,It's all your fault! 
Utena,What? 
Nanami,It's your fault my brother started being cold to me.
Utena,What're you talking about?! 
Nanami,Don't play dumb. 
Utena,Play dumb about what? 
Nanami,Quit hitting on my brother! 
Utena,"Hey, wait a sec Nanami! "
Anthy,"Look out, Utena-sama! "
Akio,Practical jokes are a bad idea in the stairwell.
Nanami,Who're you? 
Utena,Akio-san... 
Nanami,The Chairman of the Board? 
Akio,I'm still just a proxy...even though I'm living here.
Akio,I got engaged to the daughter of the Chairman.
Akio,"Okay, all set. "
Nanami,T-thank you. 
Akio,"No, not at all. Utena-san? "
Utena,Y-yes? 
Akio,Here. 
Akio,"Here, could you put this on that shelf over there?"
Utena,Sure. 
Utena,"Uh, sorry for drifting off like that. "
Akio,Not at all. 
Anthy,"Here we are, shaved ice. "
Anthy,"Here, oniisama. Say ""ah"". "
Akio,"""Ah"". "
Nanami,Siblings? 
Anthy,Yes. 
Akio,My irreplaceable sister. 
Anthy,"Here, oniisama. Say ""ah"". "
Akio,"""Ah"". "
Anthy,"Oniisama, the inside of your mouth is all blue."
Akio,Yours is all red. 
Anthy,"Here, oniisama. Say ""ah"". "
Akio,"""Ah"". "
Nanami,That sort really has it good. 
Utena,"They're really flaunting it, aren't they?"
Nanami,I'm talking about the Chairman. 
Utena,"Oh, um. "
Nanami,What a waste for Himemiya Anthy to have such a kind brother like that.
Utena,How is it a waste if they're siblings? 
Nanami,"Hey, anyone would get weak in the knees with a cool brother like that."
Nanami,Even that Himemiya Anthy. 
Utena,You're the only one who's like that. 
Nanami,What're you upset about? 
Nanami,"You like the Chairman, don't you? "
Utena,What're you talking about?! 
Nanami,"See, I thought so! "
Nanami,"So, that was it. "
Nanami,Let's both do our best. 
Utena,What's that supposed to mean? 
Yuuko,"What, really? "
Keiko,Really. A perfect match. 
Aiko,"Hey, what about me, me? "
Keiko,"U-um, Nanami-sama, what was Touga-sama's bloodtype again?"
Nanami,What're you gonna do if you find out? 
Yuuko,"Er, um, nothing much. "
Aiko,Just an innocent little love compatibility prediction.
Keiko,"N-nanami-sama, which type were you again?"
Nanami,"I'm type B. My father's type B, my mother's type B, my family's type B."
Nanami,"Perhaps that's ""B"" for ""beautiful""? "
Yuuko,So Touga-sama's B too? 
Nanami,"No, my brother's type A, the perfectionist. "
Keiko,"Um, Nanami-sama? What's your father's bloodtype?"
Nanami,I said B. 
Keiko,And your mother's? 
Nanami,She's B too. 
Keiko,And Touga-sama is... 
Nanami,I just told you it's A! 
Yuuko,"But, I don't think type B parents could have a type A child..."
Keiko,Are you and Touga-sama maybe not related by blood...?
Nanami,"Shut up! Do you see any siblings as smart, popular, beautiful, and perfect as us?"
Nanami,Even if we aren't blood relatives- 
Nanami,That can't be! 
Nanami,Why? 
Nanami,Why didn't I realize until now? 
Nanami,"No. No. As I thought, there aren't any."
Nanami,Not a single photo of oniisama as a baby...
Nanami,Then...I and... 
Nanami,I and my brother... 
Nanami,Aren't really siblings. 
Nanami,Not really siblings. 
girl,"Touga, come to me... I'm all alone. "
girl,Please. If you're not here I can't go to sleep.
girl,"Hey, Touga. You can hear me, right? "
girl,"Touga, please- "
Nanami,That simply...can't be. 
Nanami,That my brother and I...aren't really siblings...
Nanami,That we're not blood relatives... 
Touga,"What's wrong, lying there with the lights off?"
Nanami,"Um, well...I fell asleep without noticing... "
Touga,"I see. By the way, do you know what happened to my cel phone?"
Touga,"I've been looking for it since yesterday, but I can't find it."
Nanami,No idea. 
Touga,You okay? Your face is red. 
Nanami,I'm okay... 
Touga,You...don't seem to have any fever. 
Nanami,Cut it out. I'm not a child. 
Touga,"Sorry about that. Then, a kiss goodnight? "
Touga,Just kidding. 
Touga,"Then, goodnight Nanami. "
Utena,She ran away? 
Juri,Yesterday Nanami came to my place and asked if she could stay.
Miki,And at my place the day before yesterday. 
Juri,Something must have happened. 
Utena,Something...? 
Miki,It's abnormal for Nanami-kun to part from Touga-sempai.
Utena,Abnormal isn't it... 
Miki&Juri,So- 
Miki,Go ahead. 
Juri,Thanks. Haven't you heard anything? 
Utena,Ran away... 
Juri,...is the issue. 
Miki,Haven't you heard anything? 
Utena,Ran away... 
Miki,...is the issue. 
Utena,Ran away... 
Nanami,"Hey, Tsuwabuki. "
Tsuwabuki,Yes? 
Nanami,"You've got a single, right? "
Tsuwabuki,That's right... 
Nanami,Tsuwabuki? 
Tsuwabuki,Yes? 
Nanami,I don't want to go home today. 
Tsuwabuki,Y-yes? 
Nanami,Can I stay at your place tonight? 
Tsuwabuki,"S-sure! It's kinda cramped, but... "
Akio,Nice putt! Ohtori Gakuen bylaw 34: 
Akio,"""Middle school students sleeping overnight outside their assigned dorms is..."
Akio,"...strictly prohibited."" "
Akio,"Would you follow me to the Chairman's Quarters, Kiryuu Nanami-kun."
Akio,"As of today, Kiryuu Nanami-kun has transferred to the Chairman's wing."
Nanami,N-nice to meet you. 
Akio,"I'm sure you know, but please get along with her."
Anthy,Nice to see you. 
Utena,Hi there. 
Nanami,Please forgive my being so selfish. 
Akio,That's fine. Making sure that each an every student has a pleasant time at the Academy is my job.
Nanami,Aren't you going to ask what happened? 
Akio,My real dream is turning the Chairman's Wing into a harem.
Nanami,Huh? 
Akio,Just kidding. 
Nanami,Oh. 
Akio,Please feel free to tell me anything. As though I was family.
Nanami,Okay. 
Utena,Is Akio-san trying to found a harem or something? Taking Nanami in and all...
Anthy,"Well, my brother draws no distinction between women."
Utena,Is that true? 
Anthy,I'm joking. 
Utena,Of course! Akio-san couldn't be that kind of person.
Utena,"He's got Kanae-san who's important to him, and plus he's your brother..."
Utena,Am I babbling? 
Anthy,Yes. 
shadow,Monkey escaped...monkey escaped... 
shadow,Where is monkey...where is monkey... 
shadow,Cuckoo! Cuckoo! 
shadow,Now I'm gonna sneak my egg into somebody else's nest and get them to raise it cuckoo.
shadow,"In the jargon this is known as ""parasitism"". "
shadow,Ta-da! A newborn cuckoo. 
shadow,"But, it's a cuckoo who's real identity is secret!"
shadow,"Check it out, mom. Some strange duck is here!"
shadow,"Nya, ugly little duckling! "
shadow,"This can't be, dammit! "
shadow,Just watch! One day a beautiful white swan -
Utena,is not what you're gonna become. 
shadow,Argh. 
shadow,Monkey detected...monkey detected...monkey fleeing...capture monkey...
all,Jan-ken-pon! 
Anthy,"My, I lost. "
Nanami,"So, I'll be taking the bed. "
Utena,"Come, you're sponging off her. Show some restraint."
Nanami,"Hey, you're sponging off her too. "
Akio,"Nanami-kun, you have a guest. "
Touga,"Nanami, I came to get you. "
Nanami,Leave. 
Touga,Nanami! 
Nanami,I can't go home with my brother. 
Touga,"What's wrong, Nanami? You have no reason to start dorm life all of a sudden."
Nanami,I can't. 
Touga,We're only siblings. Shouldn't we help each other and live for each other?
Touga,Okay? Let's go back together. 
Nanami,We're not really siblings. 
Touga,How do you know that? 
Nanami,"So it is true, after all. "
Nanami,"I thought it was a lie, a joke...but... It's cruel."
Nanami,"It's cruel, not being siblings all of a sudden."
Nanami,What should I do? 
Touga,Nanami... 
Nanami,My brother is my brother. 
Nanami,I can't just ignore everything that's happened. Because I love him.
Nanami,Because I love my brother! 
Touga,Nanami. 
Nanami,"Leave! Please, leave! "
Utena,"I see, so that's what happened. "
Utena,"I'm an only child so I can't say for sure, but that must be a shock."
Nanami,Who cares. Just leave me alone. 
Utena,"It'll sound trite, but try to cheer up. Nothing's changed."
Utena,And I'm sure nothing will change. 
Nanami,"I told you to leave me alone, didn't I?"
Utena,Where're you going? 
Nanami,The bathroom. 
Nanami,"Geez, you startled me. Um... "

Utena,"That Nanami! How can she hog your bed when she's sponging off you?!"""
Anthy,"I'll sleep in my brother's room, so don't worry."
Utena,"Well, I guess Nanami's got it rough too."
Utena,Why can't she realize her bad brother is deceiving her?
Anthy,People find it hard to doubt those they've fallen in love with.
Anthy,They can't even imagine they're being deceived and used.
