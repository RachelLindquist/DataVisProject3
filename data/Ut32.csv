girl,"Touga, where are you now? Hey, do you hate me?"
girl,"I'm lonely. Please come, Touga. "
girl,"Hey, please...let me hear your voice. "
Anthy,Good morning. 
Utena,Morning. 
Anthy,You still look sleepy. 
Akio,"Oh, really? "
Utena,Good morning! 
Akio,Good morning. 
Utena,That apron really suits you. 
Akio,"Don't tease like that. Here, carry this. "
Utena,Okay. 
Akio,"Oh, good morning. "
Utena,"Nanami, help out too. "
Anthy,Good morning. Did you sleep well? 
text,Romance of the Dancing Girls 
Utena,This's great. 
Akio,"That's wonderful. That jam is made from the rose hips that Anthy raises,"
Akio,stewed with brandy and sugar. 
Utena,"Wow, you sure are a good cook. "
Utena,"You're siblings, but what a difference. "
Anthy,"Well, thank you. "
Utena,That wasn't a compliment. 
Anthy,Oh. 
Akio,You two are as wacky as ever. 
Utena,Me too? 
Anthy,Nanami-san? 
Anthy,Would you like some too? It's very good.
Utena,Nanami! What're you doing? You're shocking Anthy.
Nanami,I don't want any of that jam. 
Utena,Well you don't have to get so violent about it.
Utena,Wait a sec. I said wait! 
Nanami,What? 
Utena,Apologize to Akio-san and Himemiya! 
Nanami,"Are you stupid?! You don't have a clue what's going on, do you?!"
Utena,"Geez, what the heck is she babbling about?"
Akio,I'm sure she's got a lot on her mind. About siblings and such.
Utena,I'm sorry. 
Akio,There's no reason for you to apologize. 
Anthy,"And it really was good, too. "
Miki,How's your new lifestyle? 
Nanami,If it's not one thing it's another. 
Miki,"Oh, really? "
Nanami,It sucks. I feel like I don't want to be there even one second extra.
Miki,But you couldn't possibly wish for more. Normal students can't even enter the Chairman's Wing.
Nanami,Is that so? 
Miki,I'm jealous. 
Nanami,"So, wanna trade then? "
Nanami,"I'll stay at your place, and you stay in the Chairman's Wing."
Nanami,You'd get to live under the same roof with your beloved princess.
Miki,"Er, that's not what I meant... "
Nanami,What a great deal. 
Miki,Can I really? 
Miki,"If you're okay with it, I wouldn't mind. "
Miki,But I wonder what Kozue would say. And without permission from the Chairman...
Nanami,I was kidding. 
Nanami,Someone as sweet as you'd get swallowed up right off the bat.
Nanami,It feels like I don't have anywhere to go after all.
Nanami,A place for me... 
Nanami,Because I love him. 
Nanami,Because I love my brother! 
Nanami,I'm some kind of idiot. What kind of face should I make when we meet?
Touga,We're only siblings. 
Touga,Shouldn't we help each other and live for each other?
Keiko,What was that? 
Touga,"Oh, nothing. "
Keiko,Was someone looking at us? 
Touga,"Noone's there. Besides, you needn't fear the eyes of others."
Keiko,"If your sister caught us here, she'd murder me."
Touga,I don't have a sister. 
Keiko,"Yeah, but... "
Touga,We're not blood relatives. 
Keiko,What a surprise. You didn't seem like anything but a kind older brother.
Touga,That was just an act. 
Touga,"My parents told me: ""think of her as your sister and treat her well."""
Touga,"If not for that, there's no way I'd hang around her."
Touga,"That commonplace, boring woman... "
Keiko,You're scary. 
Keiko,So cold. 
Touga,"If so, what do you plan to do? "
Keiko,This is wonderful. Nanami so deserves this.
Keiko,I won't feel sorry for her. 
Nanami,Keiko. 
Anthy,Huh? What's wrong? 
Nanami,I won't forgive you even if I'd forgive everyone else. Who told you you could get close to my brother?!
Nanami,I hope you're ready for this. 
Nanami,Why? Why are you with this girl? 
Nanami,"I know you can't help going out with women. But please, anyone but her."
Nanami,There must be someone better suited for you.
Touga,Are you trying to say that you're that person?
Keiko,"What do you mean ""this girl""?! How are we two any different?!"
Keiko,Why the hell would I need anyone's permission to touch the one I love?
Keiko,You really are messed up. You make me sick.
Keiko,"I hate the air here...hey, let's go somewhere else."
Touga,"Nanami, you'll understand soon. "
Nanami,"Please wait. You were joking just now, right?"
Nanami,That all your kindness toward me was just a lie...
Nanami,"You're just teasing me again, right? "
Nanami,I've become just like them. 
Nanami,Like all those women swarming around my brother like flies...
Nanami,There's nothing left holding us together anymore.
Nanami,Nothing! 
Anthy,Now what? 
Utena,Isn't Kanae-san going home yet? 
Utena,"It's already eight o'clock. Almost time for dinner, right?"
Anthy,Yes. 
Utena,Huh? 
Utena,Are you all by yourself? 
Anthy,Yes. 
Utena,Oh. 
Anthy,Is something the matter? 
Utena,Uh-uh. 
Anthy,Shall I make something? 
Utena,"Hey, I wonder if Kanae-san's gonna eat with us."
Anthy,I don't know. 
Utena,What a pain. Once Akio-san starts stargazing he just never quits.
Anthy,True. 
Utena,"I bet you're hungry too, right Nanami? "
Nanami,Not really. 
Utena,Oh. 
Anthy,I'll have shaved ice ready in a second. 
Utena,"Well, that's okay, but... "
Utena,I'll just go up and ask him. 
Anthy,"No, don't! "
Utena,Huh? 
Anthy,"Utena-sama, you musn't disturb their time together."
Anthy,Let them enjoy their time alone. 
Anthy,Okay? 
Utena,I see. You're right. 
Utena,"Sorry. You really do care about your brother, don't you?"
Anthy,Don't mention it. 
Nanami,She's too scary... 
Anthy,Who me? Don't mention it. 
Utena,Can't sleep? 
Nanami,Did you two sleep every night facing each other like this?
Utena,Yeah. 
Nanami,"That's messed up. You're like wacked, or dense, or something."
Utena,"Hey, don't complain while you're hogging someone else's bed."
Nanami,I'm sure she's overjoyed. 
Nanami,This is the perfect excuse to go sleep with her beloved brother.
Utena,"Well, those two are really close siblings. "
Nanami,"Man, you really don't get it. "
Nanami,No wonder you can stand living around those nasty siblings.
Utena,Siblings are nice. Like they always understand each other's feelings...
Utena,"Even you an Touga, if you don't lose hold of your relationship up till now..."
Nanami,Don't associate me with him. 
Nanami,What would you know? 
Utena,Sorry. 
Touga,"That was just an act. If not for that, there's no way I'd hang around her."
Touga,"That commonplace, boring woman... "
girl,"Hello hello? It's me, me. I'm so lonely I can't sleep!"
girl,"Hey, let me hear your voice. "
Nanami,"What time do you think this is, moron? "
Nanami,Who is this? At least give me your name.
Akio,The Ends of the World. 
Nanami,What? 
Akio,Kiryuu Touga is waiting. 
Touga,"Hi, Nanami. Welcome home. "
Nanami,"Um, there's something I want to ask. "
Touga,What is it? 
Nanami,"Brother, do you know the Ends of the World?"
Touga,What do you mean by asking that? 
Nanami,"I still love you, even now. No matter how you feel about me."
Nanami,"But, I know we can't go back to the way things were."
Nanami,"So today, I sent in a request to transfer schools."
Nanami,"I plan on never seeing you again. So I want to know, this last time."
Nanami,The truth about my brother. 
text,School Transfer Request 
Nanami,How did you get that?! 
Touga,"Now now, can't you hear it? "
Touga,If your soul has not truly given up... 
Touga,...you should be able to hear... 
Touga,...the sound... 
Touga,...resounding across the Ends of the World.
Touga,"Now, allow us to invite you, to the world you desire!"
Akio,Hello. It's time to go driving. 
Nanami,It's you... 
Nanami,Just who is this person? 
Touga,"What do you mean, who is he? As you know perfectly well,"
Touga,he is the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Ohtori Academy.
Nanami,That's not what I'm asking. 
Touga,Then what? 
Nanami,He's not normal. 
Touga,How is he not normal? 
Nanami,I saw it. 
Touga,Saw what? 
Nanami,That... 
Nanami,...I can't say. It was so terrifying... 
Nanami,What's so damn funny? 
Akio,Whatever you see with those eyes of yours...is nothing other than your own world.
Nanami,Say what? 
Akio,The world you see. The world where you exist.
Akio,"You merely continue to wander the same road, unable to see the way ahead,"
Akio,a labrynthine world with no way out. 
Akio,That which you should behold is not there.
Nanami,What is this guy talking about? 
Nanami,"No, let me go! "
Touga,Isn't this what you always wanted me to do?
Nanami,"No, it isn't! "
Touga,"After all, we're not siblings. "
Nanami,That's not it! 
Touga,"Then, what do you want?! "
Akio,I shall show you the Ends of the World. 
Akio,"Yes, even you. "
Aiko,"Keiko, something lucky happened to you, right?"
Keiko,"Well, there's not much to tell. "
Keiko,"Well, if it isn't Nanami? You want something with us?"
Keiko,But I'll warn you in advance we're different from before.
Keiko,"After all, we don't have a single shred of reason to do what you tell us."
Keiko,"What a total waste of time. Kissing ass, apple-polishing, doing errands, and all for someone likeyou."
Keiko,Just remembering it makes me totally pissed off.
Keiko,We plan on paying you back starting now. I hope you're ready.
Keiko,What's with that look in your eyes?! 
Utena,Himemiya! 
Utena,"What're you doing, Nanami?! "
Nanami,I'm not like her. 
Utena,What're you talking about? 
Nanami,"Today, after school, at the Arena of Duels."
Utena,Say what?! Don't be ridiculous! 
Nanami,Are you saying you don't care what happens to this thing?
Utena,Nanami... 
shadow,"Here, psychokinesis! "
shadow,"See, my customer, this is no trick or gimmick!"
shadow,That's bogus. It's obvious that's a trick.
shadow,"Then, here we go again. Psychokinesis! "
shadow,It's a sham! A fraud! 
shadow,Geez. But what kind of trick could it be?
shadow,"How the heck would I know, you con artist?!"
shadow,Shit...special psychokinesis! 
shadow,Bogus...totally bogus... 
shadow,"Psychokinesis, maximum power! "
shadow,Bogus...bogus... 
Utena,Touga. Are you the one who put Nanami up to this?
Touga,No. Nanami came here of her own free will.
Utena,And you call yourself her brother?! 
Touga,Nanami and I aren't siblings. I'm sure you know that.
Touga,You shouldn't just stick your nose into what other people are doing.
Touga,"Right, Nanami? "
Nanami,That's right. I want to surpass everything. 
Nanami,"I'll beat you, and then my brother, myself up to now...everything..."
Utena,You dummy. 
Anthy,"O roses of noble memory, I implore you."
Anthy,Reveal thyselves. [cue duel music] Anthy&Utena: Grant me the Power to Revolutionizethe World!
Nanami,There's no meaning. My brother was part of how I could be me.
Nanami,I believed... 
Nanami,that there had to be some sort of bonds between us. But...
Nanami,there was nothing! 
Nanami,Nothing at all!! 
Utena,Does that matter? 
Utena,"Whatever shape it takes, if the thought is there..."
Nanami,Believe that if you want. 
Nanami,Go believe in the conclusion that thought leads to!
Touga,Stop that! 
Utena,Are you satisfied now? 
Nanami,Tell me. What do I have? 
Nanami,Am I just one more insect? 
Nanami,I can't stand that! 
Akio,You should tell Nanami-kun the truth. 
Touga,I suppose so. 
Akio,You really are blood relations. 
Touga,Yes. Nanami and I were both sent to the current Kiryuu residence.
Touga,It was when Nanami was still a baby. 
Akio,You'd better clear up the misunderstanding fast.
Touga,But isn't it more romantic to be siblings not bound by blood?
Akio,Such a bad brother...

Utena,These're blooming so nicely. That's my Himemiya.
Utena,Noone can beat you at raising roses. 
Anthy,"Utena-sama, I have a favor to ask. "
Utena,What is it? 
Anthy,Could you deliver these roses to my brother tonight?
Utena,To Akio-san? I don't mind... 
Anthy,"Then, please do so. "
