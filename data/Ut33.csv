voice,Once upon a time...
voice,...there was a princess grieving over the deaths of her mother and father.
voice,Before this princess appeared a prince traveling upon a white horse.
voice,"His appearance gallant, and his smile gentle, the prince enveloped the princess..."
voice,"...in the scent of roses, and wiped away her tears."
voice,"""Little one bearing up alone under grief,"
voice,"please lose not thy strength and nobility when thou growest up."""
voice,"""As a token of this day, please retain this."""
voice,"""Pray, shall we meet once more?"" "
voice,"""This ring should guide thee to me."" "
voice,Was the ring from the prince meant as an engagement ring?
voice,"That part was good, "
voice,"but because of the strength of her admiration for the prince,"
voice,the princess made up her mind to become a prince herself!
voice,But is that really good for her? 
title,The Prince who Runs in the Night 
Anthy,Hello? 
Anthy,Yes. 
Anthy,I was looking at the stars. 
Anthy,I didn't want to look at the real stars. 
Anthy,Have you received tonight's roses? 
Utena,Today was a total blast. I wonder how long it's been since I've had this much fun?
Utena,I feel like I rode all the rides I wanted to.
Utena,Himemiya should've come too. 
Utena,I'm sure being by herself wasn't this much fun.
Utena,Did I tell you that I'm an only child? 
shadows,"I wonder I wonder, do you know what I wonder?"
shadow,The stars are really gorgeous tonight. 
shadow,"If possible, we'd like all our listeners to take a look at the stars our their windows."
shadow,The beautiful Autumn constellations are twinkling.
shadow,"Tonight, we'll be together forever! "
shadow,"Now then, it's time for the Pop Quiz! "
shadow,"What is ""something eternal""? "
shadow,That's an eternal mystery. 
shadow,Who's our first respondant for tonight? 
shadow,"Let's see. His penname is ""Ends of the World""."
shadow,He sure has a weird name. 
shadow,"Well, let's call him! "
Akio,Yes. 
shadow,"Good evening! Is this Mr. ""Ends of the World""?"
Akio,Yes. 
shadow,Have you been listening to the program just now?
Akio,Of course. 
shadow,You've got a really sexy voice. 
shadow,"Thanks for your postcard. What sort of work do you do, Mr. ""Ends of the World."""
Akio,I'm an educator. Plus some minor part time work.
shadow,Are educators really allowed to moonlight? 
Akio,"Well, I've had good luck so far keeping it a secret."
shadow,"Thank you very much. Then, let's go straight to the quiz."
shadows,"I wonder, I wonder, do you know what I wonder?"
shadow,Multiple choice. Which of the following three things is eternal?
shadow,1. A diamond. 2. A beautiful memory. 3. Canned peaches.
Akio,That would be... 
shadow,Would be? 
Akio,"Sorry, I've got another call. "
shadow,What? But we're on the air right now! 
Akio,It's me. Yeah. Yeah. Understood. 
Akio,I'll be right there. 
Akio,"Sorry, something came up at work. "
shadow,"""Work""? Which? "
Akio,The part time.

Saionji,What the hell is that? 
Touga,"Now, allow us to invite you, to the world you desire!"
Saionji,The Rose Bride is mine! 
Touga,What do you want? What are you after? 
Touga,What do you want to be? 
Saionji,What will you do if I tell you? 
Saionji,"First of all, I don't trust you. "
Touga,"Hey now, aren't you my one and only best friend?"
Saionji,"""There's no such thing as friendship in this world."""
Touga,"Oh, really? "
Saionji,That's right! 
Utena,You said you saw what?! 
Saionji,The world! 
Touga,"Isn't this because you believe if you go there, you can acquire something eternal,"
Touga,"for example, eternal friendship? "
Touga,"There was that girl who said she wanted to see something eternal, right?"
Saionji,Really? I don't remember too well. 
Touga,"That night, he saved that girl and brought her out of the coffin."
Akio,"Lucifer. ""Akio"", my name, comes from that planet."
Touga,Akio-san showed that girl something eternal.
Touga,He saved her. 
Utena,If you really love her then try putting yourself in Himemiya's place!
Saionji,That's right. I used to think all the time about the Rose Bride's feelings in my own way.
Saionji,That's why I got so passionate. But now I understand.
Saionji,That the Rose Bride has no will of her own!
Anthy,Utena-sama? 
Utena,What? 
Anthy,Nevermind... 
Utena,Himemiya! 
shadow,That challenger just barely lost. 
shadow,"Well, the champion's fighting style was truly magnificent."
shadow,Now the King of Impersonation has been on top for the last eight weeks!
shadow,Just four more matches and it'll be time to fight the glorious Grand Champion of the Kings of Impersonation!
Utena,That champion is so amazing. 
Utena,I wonder if he'll be able to challenge the Grand Champion of the Kings of Impersonation?
Utena,I hope he makes it. 
Anthy,"Oh, are you all right standing by yourself? "
Kozue,"Thank you. But since you've come all this way out here,"
Kozue,the cute younger sister will tactfully bow out.
Kozue,Take your time. 
Kozue,"This letter. Is it from ""her""? "
Miki,Yeah. 
Miki,It's from our mother. 
Utena,"Wow, that's cool, getting a letter from your mother."
Utena,"I don't have any family, so I'm a bit jealous."
Kozue,We don't need any parents. 
Kozue,"After all, we're wild animals. "
Miki,Quit badmouthing them. Mother and Father are always concerned about us...
Kozue,"Oh dear, I made you get all serious. "
Miki,Yeah. It was in the letter from mother. 
Miki,"No, Kozue and I aren't opposed to it. "
Miki,"Father, it's entirely up to you. "
Miki,"I don't think we'll be able to make it to the wedding, but we'll at least send a telegram."
Miki,What? With who? 
Miki,"Oh, don't bother. You mean new mother, right?. Don't worry about that."
Miki,Father? 
Anthy,Don't worry. Calling myself his mother so suddenly would be too shameless.
Miki,"If Dueling means being manipulated by selfish adults, I'm stopping right now."
Utena,"I swear, she just won't quit! "
Utena,"She's got the nickname ""alum"". Why it's ""alum"" I don't know,"
Utena,"but before that was ""teacup"". And before that was...what was it?"
Utena,What was it? 
Utena,"Oh, damn it! I left the rolls sitting out from this morning."
Utena,I wonder if Himemiya'll put them in the fridge okay.
Utena,"If they don't get put into a plastic bag, they'll start smelling like the stuff around them."
Kozue,You don't have to be so bashful. 
Kozue,"If she's so important to you, then make her yours."
Kozue,What I want is for you to be happy. 
Miki,"What're you talking about, all of a sudden?"
Kozue,I'm always honest with my feelings. That's all.
Kozue,I don't lie. 
Kozue,"If everything around you is dirty, don't you have no choice but to get dirty too?"
Kozue,You've got no choice but to get dirty and then get what you want.
Miki,Himemiya-san! 
Kozue,What kind of amazing power? 
Miki,Kozue! What're you doing?! 
Utena,I wonder what made him Duel me so suddenly? 
Anthy,Who knows. 
Miki,Kozue!! 
Kozue,You'll lose if you don't keep your eyes on what you're doing.
Utena,"I mean, Miki's more... "
Anthy,More what? 
Miki,What?! 
Kozue,Coward. 
Akio,Yes. 
shadow,"Good evening! Is this Mr. ""Ends of the World""?"
Akio,Yes. 
shadow,We finally got through! 
shadow,It really isn't good to hang up or switch calls all of a sudden when you're on the air.
Akio,Sorry about that. It was an emergency. 
shadow,"Well then, let's go on to the second question!"
Akio,There's another one? 
shadow,"'Cause it's a rule. I wonder, I wonder, do you know what I wonder!"
shadow,"Multiple choice. Of the following three choices, which is the miracle?"
shadow,1. Edison's invention. 2. A meeting with a prince. 3. A can of coelacanth.
Akio,A miracle. Yes...the power of miracles. 
Ruka,"I was wondering how much you'd grown while I was away,"
Ruka,but it looks like I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up.
Juri,"So it really was you, Captain. "
Ruka,"Hey hey, you're the captain now, Arisugawa. "
Juri,And whatever you're plotting as a Duelist is none of my concern.
Juri,But... 
Ruka,But? 
Juri,Keep your hands off of Shiori. 
Ruka,What for? 
Juri,Shiori is... 
Juri,Shiori is an old friend of mine. 
Ruka,I see. I understand what you're saying. 
Ruka,But I think you're misunderstanding something.
Juri,What? 
Ruka,I said already that I was going to live the carefree life.
Ruka,Why shouldn't I be free to enjoy romance with anyone in the Academy I want?
Shiori,U-um...I'm sorry... 
Shiori,"I, um, wasn't trying to... "
Ruka,I see. So it was you. 
Shiori,What...? 
Ruka,"While I was away, somebody polished my sword every day."
Ruka,I was so happy. 
Ruka,"It was you, right? "
Shiori,"Yes. All for your sake, "
Shiori,every day I polished this sword... 
Ruka,Thank you. You're such a gentle person. 
Shiori,"Oh no, I'm not- "
Utena,"It's easy to mess up measures, isn't it?"
Utena,"A while ago, I messed up when measuring maccaroni and ended up filling this great big pot."
Utena,"And, it's really bad when you mess up the seasonings."
Utena,If you're not careful you start putting in more and more and end up screwing up.
Utena,Portions that would feed three turn into enough for ten and stuff.
Utena,And you can't exactly undo it. 
Utena,"Well, you can think you're just saving it for later..."
Utena,for hamburgers and lunchboxes and stuff like that...
Utena,But that won't work for stuff like stews.
Utena,"You always try to do just what it says in the book, right?"
Utena,"You do just what it says and the flavor always seems to come out wrong, doesn't it?"
Utena,I wonder why. 
Utena,Huh? The tables got turned. 
Shiori,Do you know how much I cared about you?
Shiori,That's right! I polished your sword every day!
Shiori,Only for you... 
Ruka,Oh that? That wasn't my sword. 
Ruka,"Your acting was really something. Great, for an ad-lib."
Utena,"Why, senpai? "
shadow,It seems he knew how sick he was. But he forced his way out of the hospital anyway and went backto school.
shadow,I bet there's somebody he loved in the Fencing Club.
shadow,"Come to think of it, he was always saying:"
Ruka,"Juri, don't worry. "
shadow,"""I want to give the Power of Miracles to the one I love."""
Ruka,Don't worry. 
shadow,"""I want to free her."" "
Akio,Miracles happen every day. It's just that people don't realize it.
shadow,"Um, enough of the deep stuff. Please answer promptly."
Akio,Answer? 
Utena,"Um, having fun until this late... "
Utena,When I get back I gotta make lunch for tomorrow right away.
Utena,"Um, what should I make? "
Utena,"There's some salmon left, so...salmon and..."
Utena,Then boil some asparagus...and fix some omelette real quick...
Utena,"Usually, we just use all the leftovers from dinner, see..."
Utena,...since there's two helpings for Himemiya and me...
Utena,What a mess. What'll I do? 
Utena,I can't think of anything. 
Utena,"Salmon, and asparagus, and omelette...but what else?"
Utena,What should I do? 
Utena,"Hey, what do you think? Maybe sandwitches? "
Utena,"If I mix the asparagus and salmon with some mayonaise, break in a boiled egg..."
Utena,I don't know. What'll I do? 
Utena,Oh man. Isn't there anything else? 
Utena,I can't remember. 
Utena,And those are sitting out too...will they be okay?
Utena,"We always put them into you know... and... in the fridge..., but today..."
Utena,Um...

Utena,What is eternity? 
Akio,Is that Anthy? 
Anthy,Yes. 
Akio,What're you doing there? 
Anthy,I was watching the stars. 
Akio,The stars are beautiful tonight. 
Akio,You didn't have to watch the Planetarium. 
Anthy,I didn't want to look at the real stars. 
Anthy,Have you received today's roses? 
Akio,"Yeah, I received them. "
Akio,Thanks for your help. 
Akio,Weren't the stars beautiful tonight? 
Utena,I didn't expect that to happen. 
Utena,All I came for today was to deliver roses.
