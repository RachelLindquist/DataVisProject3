Akio,I just found a comet.
Akio,A new star that no one knows about yet. 
Akio,But I won't tell anybody... 
Akio,"...or give it a name. Strange, isn't it?"
Akio,I feel like when I discover a new star I make it mine.
Akio,But a star is a star. It belongs to nobody.
Akio,It belongs to nobody. 
Anthy,"Good night, brother. "
Akio,Do you still torment me? 
Utena,I'll become a Prince.

Utena,"You know, I'm really not good with that stuff..."
shadow,I'm sure that a new world would open up for our Theater Club if you joined us.
shadow,You bet it'd open up. Fans of yours would be joining in droves!
Utena,But... 
shadow,Don't worry. Our judgement never fails. 
shadow,Never ever. 
Utena,But I can't act. I'm no good on stage. 
shadow,That's no big deal. 
shadow,Flowers will bud just by you standing onstage.
shadow,You bet they will. A star is born! 
shadow,"Anyways, please come see our play after school tomorrow."
shadow,It's such an ultra-sad story! 
Utena,Huh?

boy,"Tenjou, we're counting on you for next week's match."
Utena,"Y-yeah, okay. "
Wakaba,It must be tough being so popular. 
Utena,Huh? 
Wakaba,"So, did you pick? "
Utena,"Oh, yeah... "
Wakaba,Mark the ones you like. I can get someone in the Photo Club to make copies.
Utena,There aren't any with Himemiya in them. 
Wakaba,"Well, she's so unsociable. "
Wakaba,She almost never go to events or anything. 
Wakaba,I didn't know our school had a Theater Club.
Akio,It's been a long time since I've photographed something besides stars.
Akio,But why'd you want to have commemorative photos all of a sudden?
Utena,"Well, it's like... "
Utena,"Akio-san, you get in too. "
Akio,You really treasure your memories. 
Utena,"Well, that's not quite it, but... "
Anthy,Stop that. Chu-chu. 
Akio,"That ring is a memory from your childhood, right?"
Utena,That's right. I got invited to this play the Theater Club's doing after school today.
Utena,"Shall we go together, just the three of us?"
Anthy,Sorry. My eyes were closed.

chalk,The Tale of the Rose 
Akio,It's been so long since I've seen a play.
Anthy,This should be fun. 
Utena,"Do you like plays, Akio-san? "
Akio,"""All life's a stage."" "
Akio,"All people are either actors, or spectators. "
Utena,But I wonder why no one else is here? Maybe we're too early.
shadow,Extra. Extra extra extra. 
shadow,"Finally, finally it's begun. "
shadow,The sealed light. The sorrowful Prince. 
shadow,That which could not be told until now: the Tale of the Rose!
shadow,"Beware! Beware! She's here in the world, somewhere."
shadow,"You too, beware! "
shadow,"I wonder I wonder, do you know what I wonder?"
shadow,This is a story from the days when all the women of the world were still princesses.
shadow,"In those days, the world had not yet been completely engulfed in darkness."
shadow,"Because, the Rose Prince was there. "
shadow,Growl growl-growl-growl! 
shadow,Save me! A monster is chasing me! 
shadow,Gallop gallop gallop! Accursed beast! I shall slay you!
shadow,Glargh... 
shadow,"Are you unhurt, princess? "
shadow,"Thank you, Rose Prince. "
shadow,"Then, the promised kiss! "
shadow,Growl growl growl growl 
shadow,"Save me! It's Christmas Eve, yet I'm all alone!"
shadow,"Gallop gallop gallop! Fear not, for I have reserved us a table at a French restaurant!"
shadow,"Thank you, Rose Prince. "
shadow,"Then, the promised kiss! "
shadow,"Yes, all the women of the world were princesses."
shadow,"Because we were all protected by the Rose Prince, the world was overflowing with light."
shadow,But... 
shadow,"Hello there, Rose Prince. "
shadow,"What is the matter, old woman? "
shadow,Calamity is threatening the world. 
shadow,"There is one who plans to steal away all the light in the world,"
shadow,and plunge the land deep into darkness. 
shadow,Who is this you speak of?! 
shadow,It is a witch. 
shadow,A witch?! 
shadow,Yes. Surely you must know of the castle which floats in the sky.
shadow,That is the witch's castle! 
shadow,The witch who dwells there schemes even now to steal all the light of the world.
shadow,"What is this ""light of the world"". "
shadow,Know ye not of the light? 
shadow,"It is that which is eternal, "
shadow,"shining, "
shadow,"the power of miracles, "
shadow,the power to revolutionize the world. 
shadow,"Then I shall slay this witch, and protect the light of the world!"
shadow,"Thus, the prince flew to the castle to protect the light of the world and to dispatch the witch."
shadow,However! 
shadow,Welcome to within the castle. 
shadow,Forsooth! Tis the selfsame old woman! 
shadow,You fool! This is a trap to emprison you within the castle!
shadow,YOU are the light! 
shadow,"Why do you do this? Witch, who art thou?"
shadow,Have ye not recognized me yet? 
shadow,Gadzooks! You are my...sister!! 
shadow,"Correct, brother, it is I. "
shadow,You are the Prince who protects all the women of the world.
shadow,You make all the women of the world into princesses -
shadow,the Rose Prince. 
shadow,And I am your - 
shadow,sister. 
shadow,I'm the only one who can't become your princess!
shadow,But there's nothing I can do about that...
shadow,That's why I - 
shadow,became a witch! 
shadow,Women who can't be princesses have no choice but to become witches.
shadow,"And so the witch imprisoned the Prince, and the world was completely enclosed in darkness."
shadow,The witch roams this world of darkness even now.
shadow,"Seeking the young and noble, to sacrifice them anew!"
shadow,"Surely the light presents an obstacle to the witch, to her dominion over the dark."
shadow,Beware! Beware! She is still somewhere in this world...
shadow,"You too, beware! "
Saionji,Touga. 
Touga,You're late. Would you hurry up and fight me?
Saionji,Isn't this a surprise? 
Touga,I'm all fired up. I've got a match coming up soon.
Touga,It seems a certain person isn't pleased with her continuing to win...
Touga,...without the Sword of Dios appearing. 
Saionji,I wonder why we all keep losing to that wench.
Touga,She's not just a wench. She's a girl who was shown something eternal in her youth.
Saionji,She's that girl?! 
shadows,Cheers! 
shadow,Our performance today was the greatest! 
shadow,"Ah, the bliss of being an actress! "
shadow,Extra extra extra extra... 
shadow,"Gadzooks, you are my sister! "
shadow,"Yes, my brother! "
shadow,"The sealed light, the sorrowful Prince, the Tale of the Rose now beblub blub...."
shadow,"That girl's got talent, but she's kinda weird."
shadow,Maybe she doesn't have any friends. 
shadow,I don't wanna hear that from you! 
shadow,She definitely doesn't have any friends. 
shadow,"No, she doesn't. "
Anthy,Good night. 
Utena,You going to bed already? 
Utena,"So, what did you think of the show today?"
Akio,A very sophomoric play. 
Utena,Sophomoric...? 
Akio,Would you like another cup? 
Utena,"Oh, sure. "
Utena,Thanks. 
Akio,It must be hard on you. 
Utena,Huh? 
Akio,Anthy. I understand. 
Akio,It must be tiring being friends with her for so long.
Utena,"Not at all. On the contrary, it's a big help having her around."
Akio,Really? 
Utena,Himemiya's an important friend to me. 
Akio,"What is a friend, to you? "
Utena,"Well, so...it's someone important, right?"
Akio,Then...that makes us friends too? 
Akio,You're always wearing this ring. 
Utena,"Well, I got it from a Prince. "
Akio,You didn't even take it off that night. 
Utena,"Please, no more. "
Akio,Loyalty to your prince? 
Utena,I think I... 
Utena,want to become a Prince...myself... 
Akio,You think? 
Utena,It's just that...when I look at this I remember.
Utena,That I mustn't lose my nobility. 
Utena,I don't really remember that time too well.
Akio,"""That time""? What do you mean? "
Utena,I can't remember very well. 
Dios,What're you doing there? 
Utena,Nothing. 
Utena,"Hey, are you the Grim Reaper? "
Dios,No. I do not bring death. 
Utena,You're pretty. 
Utena,Who's that? 
Dios,A witch. 
Utena,A witch? 
Dios,The Rose Bride. 
Utena,"The ""Rose Bride""? "
Dios,Those who can die are lucky. 
Dios,She cannot die. Just go on suffering. 
Utena,Why? 
Dios,It's her punishment for stealing a prince from all the women of the world.
Dios,That which could not be told until now: the Tale of the Rose.
Dios,Anthy... 
Dios,Anthy... 
Anthy,I'm right here. 
crowd,Prince!...we beg you...please save us...
man,"Prince, we know you're here! Come out and fight for us!"
man,You're the only one who can save our daughter!
man,All of our daughters are waiting for you!
man,Hurry up and fight! Prince! 
Anthy,You mustn't move anymore! 
Dios,But they're calling for help... 
Dios,I've got to go to them... 
crowd,Please save us...save us... 
Anthy,Stop now. Don't fight anymore. 
Anthy,You'll die. 
crowd,"Prince!...Prince, please fight!... "
man,Who're you?! 
Anthy,Dios is gone. He's mine and mine alone. 
Anthy,I've sealed him somewhere where your hands can never reach.
crowd,What?...how dreadful... 
man,Infernal witch! 
Dios,She sacrificed herself to save her beloved Prince.
Dios,Even though she was the only one who truly loved the Prince...
Dios,"And what's more, the Prince who loved her was no longer the Prince she knew, but instead..."
Dios,he became the Ends of the World. 
Utena,This is... 
Dios,And her suffering was all that remained. 
Utena,"Hey, save her! "
Utena,It's too cruel! 
Utena,Save her! 
Utena,Save her... 
Dios,She can no longer be saved. 
Dios,The only one who can save her is a Prince she believes in.
Utena,"You're a Prince, right? "
Dios,I can't become her Prince. 
Utena,Why not? 
Dios,You're such a gentle child. Thank you for your tears.
Utena,Then I'll become a Prince! 
Utena,I'll become her Prince and save her! 
Dios,"If you can retain that nobility even when you grow up,"
Dios,you may indeed be able to save her from her eternal suffering.
Dios,But you will surely forget all about this night.
Dios,"And even if you do remember, you're a girl."
Dios,Soon you'll become a lady. 
Utena,I will! I'll become a Prince no matter what!
Dios,Then that ring will surely lead you here again.
Utena,I kinda feel like I saw a familiar landscape in a dream...
Utena,I just can't remember. 
Utena,Can't you sleep? 
Anthy,I was looking at your face while you slept.
Anthy,Who are you?

Utena,That Touga...he dragged me out horseback riding with him.
Anthy,Aren't the horses adorable? 
Utena,"But while we were riding together, I lost my balance and almost fell off the horse."
Anthy,"Ooh, how scary. "
Utena,But I got saved at the last moment by Akio-san riding a white horse.
Utena,"But just what does Touga think he's doing, getting close to me all of a sudden?"
