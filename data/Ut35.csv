voice,Once upon a time...
voice,...there was a princess grieving over the deaths of her mother and father.
voice,Before this princess appeared a prince traveling upon a white horse.
Utena,Who's that? 
Dios,A witch. 
Utena,A witch? 
Dios,The Rose Bride. 
Utena,"The ""Rose Bride""? "
Dios,She sacrificed herself to save her beloved Prince.
Dios,Even though she was the only one who truly loved the Prince...
Dios,"And what's more, the Prince who loved her was no longer the Prince she knew, but instead..."
Dios,he became the Ends of the World. 
Utena,Save her! 
Utena,Save her... 
Dios,You're such a gentle child. Thank you for your tears.
Dios,The only one who can save her is a Prince she believes in.
Dios,I can't become her Prince. 
Utena,Then I'll become a Prince! 
Dios,"If you can retain that nobility even when you grow up,"
Dios,you may indeed be able to save her from her eternal suffering.
Dios,But you will surely forget all about this night.
Dios,"And even if you do remember, you're a girl."
Dios,Soon you'll become a lady. 
Utena,I will! I'll become a Prince no matter what!
Dios,Then that ring will surely lead you here again.

Akio,"Finally, the next Duel will determine who will Revolutionize the World."
Touga,"Yes, that's about the size of it, isn't it."
Akio,Will that be Tenjou Utena? Or will that be you?
Utena,I will! I'll become a Prince. 
Anthy,Is something the matter? 
Utena,"Himemiya, I... "
Anthy,Yes? 
Utena,No...never mind. 
Anthy,You look a little pale... 
Utena,Sorry. I'm being a little strange. 
Utena,There's something I just can't seem to remember...
Utena,...like a dream I saw at dawn. 
Anthy,"Ah, you're talking about a dream? "
Utena,A dream? 
Anthy,Isn't it? 
Utena,Well...it might be. 
Utena,"I don't know for sure, but I feel like I promised somebody something important."
Utena,"Hey, Himemiya. Show me your face. "
Utena,"Could it be you, and me... "
Akio,"Ah, here you are. "
Utena,Akio-san. 
Utena,Did you need something? 
Akio,"Well, I heard you weren't feeling too well lately,"
Akio,So I thought I might invite you on a stroll or something to help you feel better.
Utena,Me? 
Akio,Would that be a problem? 
Utena,"No, of course not. "
Akio,"Good. Oh, may I borrow Utena-san, Anthy? "
Anthy,"Yes, brother. "
Akio,"Then, Utena-san, shall we depart? "
Utena,"You sure, Himemiya? "
Anthy,Yes. 
Utena,"Then, see you in a little while. "
Anthy,See you later. 
Akio,Thank you for always being nice to my sister.
Utena,"Not at all. I mean, we're friends. "
Akio,"""Friends""...is it? "
Akio,If that thought should last forever... 
Akio,I was just thinking it would be nice if you and Anthy remained friends forever.
Utena,"Well, of course. "
Akio,"The red poppy is native to Southern Europe, and is also known as Gubijin flower."
Akio,"There's a legend that they grew on the spot where Gubijin, who was loved by Kouu, was buried long ago."
Akio,"Because of that, in the language of flowers...is something wrong?"
Utena,"Um, no. I just thought that all you knew a lot about was stars."
Utena,But you know a lot about plants too. 
Akio,"I wouldn't say a ""lot"". "
Utena,So what do red poppies mean in the language of flowers?
Akio,"In the language of flowers, the red poppy means..."
Touga,And what are your intentions? 
Akio,Regarding what? 
Touga,You seemed to be getting along pretty well with Tenjou Utena.
Akio,"Oh, are you worried about her? "
Touga,"Well, I'm worried. "
Akio,How are you worried? 
Touga,She's my important opponent in the Duels. I was planning on undermining her a bit.
Akio,Really? In that case that's perfect. Can I entrust something to you?
Touga,What would that be? 
Akio,I want you to deliver a present to her. 
Akio,I don't care what. You choose something suitable.
Touga,You sure you don't want to choose it yourself?
Akio,"I don't mind. After all, you're the playboy."
Akio,Choosing presents should be right up your alley.
Touga,You don't know her as well as I thought. 
Touga,You can't sway her that way. 
Touga,"Actually, I gave her a present as a dress before, but she wasn't the sort to be moved by gifts."
Akio,Have you forgotten? 
Akio,She's the kind of girl who treasures an old ring given to her by a man whose name she doesn't evenknow.
Touga,That's true. That's the thing that binds her.
Akio,"Well, no matter. "
Akio,Do whatever you want. I'd like to see how you handle things.
Akio,But don't forget about the present. Tell her it's from me.
Touga,"This is a game, isn't it? "
Akio,Yes indeed. 
Touga,Tenjou-kun! 
Utena,Yes! Mr. President... 
Touga,I wish you wouldn't make that face at me so quickly.
Touga,You must really hate me. 
Wakaba,Damn straight she does. 
Utena,Do you need something from me? 
Touga,I was asked to give you this by the Chairman.
Utena,By Akio-san? 
Wakaba,"Wow, how pretty! "
Utena,Akio-san gave these to me? 
Touga,Yeah. 
Wakaba,"That's awesome, Utena! "
Utena,But...can I really accept these? 
Utena,"Besides, these aren't me. "
Wakaba,What're you talking about? Sure they are!
Wakaba,Try them on. 
Utena,It won't work...cut it out. 
Wakaba,It will too work. See? 
Wakaba,That's cool. 
Utena,"No, that's not what I'm talking about, but..."
Wakaba,You being bashful? 
Wakaba,"I am TOO jealous, you little tramp! "
Utena,"That hurt, Wakaba! "
Touga,"Tenjou-kun, could you come with me for a bit?"
Touga,There's something I'd like to consult you about.
Utena,Um...consult me? 
Utena,Don't you have the wrong person? 
Touga,I'm sorry. There's something I really want you to hear.
Touga,"Please, Tenjou-kun. "
Wakaba,Don't buy it for one second. 
Wakaba,He might do something terrible to you again.
Utena,But... 
Wakaba,Geez! You're too soft! 
Wakaba,Just don't go anywhere dark alone with him.
Utena,What's that supposed to mean? 
Utena,Didn't you wanna consult me about something?! 
Touga,Don't get impatient. It's true I want to talk with you.
Utena,"Hey, don't be so reckless! "
Touga,"Tenjou-kun, I guess being an all-around athlete like you doesn't include horseback riding."
Utena,Of course it doesn't. There aren't that many people who ride.
Touga,Really? 
Touga,But don't horses go hand in hand with the Prince you admire so much?
Utena,What're you trying to say? 
Touga,Who knows. 
Utena,"You dummy, cut it out! "
Akio,That was a bit of a close call. 
Utena,Akio-san. 
Akio,But thank goodness. I always ride this course.
girl,Um...um... 
girl,Won't you read this for me? 
girl,"I've admired you for so long...um...and so...err, I..."
girl,How should I put it... 
Touga,Thank you. Your earnestness is wonderful. 
Touga,"Kiryuu Touga, the playboy Student Council President...is it?"
Touga,"""Playboy"" sounds old-fashioned. "
Saionji,"Oh, it's you. "
Touga,I wanna spar. 
Saionji,Something happened to you. 
Touga,Nothing happened. 
Saionji,Liar. That confidence is gone from your sword.
Touga,"Oh really?! You sound so smart, Saionji. "
Touga,You know that much about me? 
Saionji,"Hell yes. You're arrogant and haughty, and full of confident ambition."
Touga,"Hey now, that's not a nice thing to say."
Saionji,"That's the kind of guy you are. You play the gentleman,"
Saionji,"but you've never really loved anyone, and you see everyone else only as pawns to be controlled."
Saionji,That was your strength. 
Saionji,But can that sword of yours defeat her now?
Touga,You're talking too much. You'll leave yourself open.
shadow,"I wonder I wonder, do you know what I wonder, Miss?"
shadow,"Oh, what is it I wonder? "
shadow,"I'm the cool sailor, the nice-guy genius Cassanova!"
shadow,The incomparable Playboy Fisherman! 
shadow,My! 
shadow,How wonderful! 
shadow,I can't move! 
shadow,Boil me! 
shadow,Broil me! 
shadow,Slice me! 
shadow,Make me into sashimi! 
shadow,"Hah, all fish are like that. "
shadow,All fish exist for me to use. 
shadow,"I don't mean to brag, but there's no fish I couldn't catch."
shadow,"Wow, is that so? "
shadow,All the fish in the sea are at my beck and call.
shadow,"Oh, I caught another. "
shadow,What's this? It's not doing what I want it to.
shadow,Is this some new breed of fish? This's never happened before!
shadow,What the hell are you- 
shadow,"Shh. I'm a ""koi"" [Japanese for ""goldfish"", and for ""love""]."
shadow,How could a koi be in the ocean?! 
shadow,"I wonder I wonder, do you know what I wonder?"
Akio,Don't worry. See? 
Utena,Yeah. 
Akio,"His body's big, but he's quite gentle. "
Utena,It's too much to ask for...a Prince on a white horse...
Akio,They're very timid animals. 
Akio,You have to communicate well with them and get them to trust you.
Utena,Just like with people. 
Akio,He's telling me that he likes you too. 
Utena,Really? 
Anthy,Utena-sama? Utena-sama? 
Anthy,You'll catch cold. Utena-sama... 
Akio,Looks like I won the game. 
Touga,Nope. It's a draw. 
Touga,She didn't like the present after all. Just like I thought.
Akio,She was bewildered. Maybe you didn't pick a good gift-
Touga,There was no mistake in the choice of gift.
Touga,"Besides, they suited her very well. "
Akio,I'd love to see that. She's supposed to become an attractive princess after all.
Akio,"Not a Prince, but a princess. I'm sure you agree."
Touga,Well now. Who knows. 
Akio,I'm looking forward to the next Duel. 
Akio,The Prince who will revolutionize the world...
Akio,But I'm praying...for your success. 
Utena,"Living's...kinda disgusting, isn't it?"
Touga,Really. 
Utena,Yeah. It's disgusting. 
Utena,Why is everybody alive if they'll just end up dying?
Utena,And why didn't I realize that until today?
Utena,"There can't be anything eternal, can there?"
Saionji,Something eternal? 
Utena,So it's okay. I'm never leaving this coffin again.
Saionji,Who would have thought that that girl was Tenjou Utena...
Saionji,That girl who was inside the coffin. 
Touga,She's still all alone within the coffin. 
Touga,"In order to save her, I'll beat her. "
Saionji,Don't tell me you actually love Tenjou Utena?
Touga,"Well, I wonder. "
Touga,I don't even know myself. 
Saionji,We've gotten a lot of letters to date.
Saionji,From the Ends of the World. 
Saionji,"And, as written, we've fought a lot of Duels."
Touga,But I bet this will be my last letter. 
Saionji,"We don't need this ""chaban"" anymore. [""chaban"" = tea server / charade]"
Saionji,You don't need to get letters. 
Touga,You serve him directly. Just get his orders firsthand.
Saionji,Are you really happy with that? Why are you kissing his ass that much?
Touga,He's the one who saved her back then. 
Saionji,"Oh, I see. "
Touga,I want to become like him. I want power like his.
Saionji,Are you so sure? 
Touga,What? 
Saionji,It may be that the Chairman saved her back then.
Saionji,"But she's still in the coffin. No, not just her."
Saionji,We're in our coffins too. 
Utena,"Hey, stop that Chu-chu. "
Utena,That's not a caramel. 
Utena,"Okay okay, I'll show you what's inside. "
Utena,"Hey, whaddya think, Chu-Chu? "
Utena,You attach these to your ears like this.
Utena,Hey... 
Anthy,What is it? 
Utena,Nothing... 
Utena,I feel like I was just about to remember something important...
Utena,What...
