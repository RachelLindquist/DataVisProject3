Utena,Please...don't open this coffin.
Saionji,Who would have thought that that girl was Tenjou Utena...
Saionji,That girl who was inside the coffin. 
Touga,She's still all alone within the coffin. 
Touga,"In order to save her, I'll beat her. "
Saionji,It may be that the Chairman saved her back then.
Saionji,"But she's still in the coffin. No, not just her."
Saionji,We're in our coffins too.

Akio,"So, what do you think? "
Akio,"Once you get used to it, it feels pretty good, doesn't it?"
Utena,Yes...my heart was pounding. A lot. 
Akio,I see. I'm glad. 
Utena,It's been a really long time since I've spent time out in nature like this.
Utena,I feel like I'm dreaming or something. 
Utena,It was really fun. 
Akio,You're beautiful. The very image of a princess amidst the forest.
Utena,When you say that sort of thing...it sounds like you really mean it.
Akio,It's true. 
Touga,Welcome back. 
Akio,Thanks. 
Juri,I wonder why. 
Juri,"For some reaon, she looks like a girl to me now."
Miki,Well of course Tenjou-senpai's a girl. 
Juri,I know that. But... 
Miki,"Actually, she looks that way to me too. "
Juri,Really. 
Miki,"But, isn't that something wonderful? "
Juri,Do you really think so? 
Juri,"Something's about to change. No - not ""something""."
Juri,Everything. Everything in this school is about to change.
Miki,"Everything in the school...then, it's like..."
Juri,...a Revolution? 
Miki,Yes. 
Juri,That's right. The day of Revolution is fast approaching.
Juri,"But what is this frenzied, horrible feeling?"
Touga,Whaddya think? Pleasant vibrations aren't they?
Saionji,They're not moving me. 
Touga,Really. 
Saionji,You've got messed-up tastes. That's not good.
Touga,I take it you don't like it because I'm driving?
Saionji,What I don't like is being dominated. 
Saionji,Letting someone that deep into my heart.
Touga,You've always been a guy who couldn't hide his hostility.
Saionji,Hell if I care. 
Saionji,So what're you gonna do? You planning to fight Tenjou Utena like this?
Saionji,Just like the Ends of the World is telling you to?
Akio,She was beautiful. 
Touga,"Her, you mean? "
Akio,"Yeah. Pure, and magnificent. "
Akio,A peerless princess. 
Akio,My precious one. 
Touga,I know that. 
Saionji,We must rise from our coffins! 
Saionji,From within the coffins that the Ends of the World has prepared for us!
Touga,I'll give you an answer. Tonight. 
Saionji,Tonight! 
Touga,Saionji. 
Saionji,Yeah. 
Touga,Standing up is dangerous. 
Saionji,Right. 
Utena,"Oh brother, you'll catch cold. "
Utena,I wonder if Himemiya's with Akio-san again.
Utena,"Hey, Chu-Chu, are you always alone like this while Himemiya's with her brother?"
Utena,Mr. President. 
Touga,I have something important to talk to you. Will you accompany me?
Utena,"You're joking, right? Why're you bugging me at this hour?"
Touga,What if I said I wanted to talk about the Ends of the World?
Utena,Okay. 
Utena,This is my first time being in the Arena of Duels at night.
Touga,Are you scared? 
Utena,It's not that. It's just that it feels different from how it usually does.
Touga,How does it feel? 
Utena,How does it feel? Well... 
Touga,Romantic? 
Utena,No way. 
Touga,I'd be glad if the two of us could go up alone like this into the heavens.
Utena,"Hey, don't get so close to me. "
Touga,My apologies. 
Utena,Wow...this is kind of exciting. 
Utena,Just like when I went to the park at night.
Utena,To think you and I actually Dueled here...
Akio,True. 
Utena,There're so many stars. 
Utena,What? 
Touga,You're beautiful. 
Touga,How fortunate I am to have been able to meet you.
Utena,Here you go again. 
Utena,"Just forget about that stuff and get to the point, okay?"
Touga,Do you love the Chairman? 
Utena,How...how could I? 
Utena,"He's got a fiancee, you know. "
Touga,I see. 
Utena,Why'd you ask me that. What about the Ends of the World?
Touga,"The Ends of the World, huh? "
Touga,I can't reveal his name now. You'll find out who he is soon enough.
Touga,"But before that, I wanted to talk to you."
Utena,What about? 
Touga,Is there no way I can be your Prince? 
Touga,You're my only princess. 
Utena,Not that again. 
Touga,It's true. I love you. 
Touga,"From my heart, I treasure you. "
Touga,Your nobility and beauty shine on many. 
Touga,"And even if I'm not worthy of you, please, be with me for at least this instant."
Touga,Just that will do. 
Touga,"If I can just carve the memory of this night, the two of us together, within me,"
Touga,that will be enough. Will you permit me that much?
Utena,I understand. 
Touga,Thank you. 
Touga,Is there no way I can be your Prince? 
Utena,"Come to think of it, that's what I thought when we first met."
Utena,That the President might be my Prince. 
Saionji,"How'd it go? Did you get this ""answer"" you wanted?"
Touga,Yeah. Last night made it perfectly clear.
Saionji,Oh? Then care to let me in on it? 
Touga,It's now clear that she's someone very important to me.
Saionji,So now what? 
Touga,I will fight once again! 
Touga,And I must prevail. 
Touga,"After all, there's no other way to save her."
Touga,"If she wins the next duel, "
Saionji,she gets the Power to Revolutionize the World.
Saionji,But if that happens... 
Touga,...she'll fall into the Ends of the World's hands.
Saionji,"So, shall we? "
Anthy,Utena-sama. 
Utena,Hm? 
Anthy,Where were you last night? 
Utena,"Oh, um, I had stuff to do. "
Touga,Hi. May we join you? 
Utena,What did you say? 
Touga,Let me repeat myself. I want to Duel with you again.
Utena,What're you thinking? 
Touga,"You intend to protect the Rose Bride, correct?"
Utena,That's right. I won't let anybody lay a finger on her.
Touga,"Then I promise you this. If you win, none of the Student Council will ever target her again."
Touga,"But if I win, you become my woman. "
Utena,I misjudged you. I can't believe you'd say such a thing...
Touga,No objections? 
Utena,No. 
shadow,"Gallop gallop gallop. Lo, give ear to the sound if ye be afar!"
shadow,And behold if ye be close at hand! 
shadow,For I be a Prince upon a white horse! 
shadow,My! A Prince of white horses! 
shadow,"This flowing mane, these splendid forelegs...how magnificent!"
shadow,"See here, that's not the Prince of white horses, that's the white horse of the Prince."
shadow,The Prince is me. 
shadow,"But, does that mean you're not a human Prince?"
shadow,"I'm human, but I'm called a ""Prince upon a white horse."""
shadow,"Well anyway, you're a Prince too right? How wonderful!"
shadow,Do you really want a horse Prince? 
shadow,Of horse! 
Touga,This fight will determine the one who shall Revolutionize the World.
Utena,"Who cares about that. Anways, your promise not to touch Anthy if I win is for real, right?"
Touga,Yeah. Utena/Anthy: Grant me the power to Revolutionizethe World!
Utena,We just met here last night! 
Touga,"No personal feelings when you're in battle, Tenjou-kun!"
Touga,Tenjou...I'll protect you. 
Utena,How many times have I fought with you here?
Touga,This is the third. 
Utena,How strange...it feels like we've fought so often...
Anthy,Utena-sama... 
Anthy,Utena-sama! 
Utena,Himemiya! Himemiya!! 
Anthy,Utena-sama!! 
Utena,"Hey, Himemiya... "
Utena,Believe in me. I'll protect you no matter what.
Anthy,Really? 
Utena,Can't you believe in me? 
Utena,Let's go. Akio-san is waiting. 
Touga,Hold it. You've now become the one who will Revolutionize the World.
Touga,"But you mustn't open your heart to the Ends of the World, or to the Rose Bride."
Touga,That's the last thing I can say. 
Utena,"Not that again...farewell, senpai. "
Saionji,Touga. 
Touga,Yeah. 
Saionji,Is it over for us? 
Touga,No. It's not over until we see it through the very end.
Anthy,I bet you're tired from today. 
Anthy,Please get a good night's sleep. 
Utena,Yeah. Isn't this great? Now there's nobody left who'll target you.
Anthy,Yes. 
Utena,Akio-san... 
Utena,"Oh, shoot. I gotta get in bed the right way."
Utena,Himemiya? 
Utena,"Ah, there she is. "
