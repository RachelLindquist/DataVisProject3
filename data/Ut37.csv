Utena,I'll become a Prince no matter what!
Dios,"If you can retain that nobility even when you grow up,"
Dios,That ring... 
Utena,That ring...will surely lead you to me again.
text,The One Who Will Revolutionize the World 
Akio,Didn't you sleep well? 
Utena,Huh? 
Akio,You've got that look. Is something bothering you?
Utena,"Yeah, sort of. But it's not the sort of thing I can talk over with others."
Utena,"Everyone has things they can't say to others, don't they?"
Akio,Yes. 
Akio,"Come to think of it, you're not wearing it today."
Akio,Your ring. 
Utena,If...you've got time... 
Utena,If you've got time after school today...could you come with me?
Anthy,I'm sorry. 
Anthy,"This was yours and not mine, wasn't it?"
Akio,"You're inviting me on a date, aren't you?"
Utena,Of course. 
Akio,Then I'll be waiting in front of the house at 5 o'clock.
Utena,"Wow, being able to go on a date with a cool guy like you is every girl's dream!"
Anthy,*whistle* 
Touga,Did you get one? 
Saionji,Yeah. I just got a letter from the Ends of the World.
Saionji,A farewell letter. 
Touga,I bet she got a letter too by now. 
Touga,A different letter from ours. 
Touga,But she isn't interested in the Revolution. 
Saionji,Then will Dios's power stay sealed and the Revolution just not happen?
Touga,I don't know. Even I don't know the Ends of the World's true objective.
Saionji,"By the way, does Tenjou Utena know who the Ends of the World really is?"
Touga,"Man, it's been a while since you and I rode bike together."
Saionji,Yeah. I wonder how long... 
Anthy,*whistle* 
Utena,That was fun. Thanks for today. 
Akio,"You really aren't wearing your ring, are you?"
Akio,Why? 
Utena,I was thinking it maybe didn't suit me.
Akio,Your clothing suits you quite well. 
Akio,Shall I give you a ring that suits your clothing better?
Utena,I wonder if Himemiya's asleep already. 
Akio,"Tonight, you... "
Utena,What is it? 
Akio,"Tonight, you somehow seem very feminine. "
Utena,"Well, I am a girl. "
Akio,True. 
Utena,The Big Dipper. 
Utena,"Come to think of it, you're not talking about the stars today."
Akio,Shall I tell you the truth? 
Akio,"Actually, I have no interest whatsoever in the stars."
Anthy,"Welcome back, Utena-sama. "
Utena,"Oh, you're still awake. "
Utena,Are you upset? 
Anthy,What about? 
Utena,I thought you'd say that. 
Utena,Maybe I picked on you a little. 
Utena,I seem really feminine tonight. Akio-san said that.
Utena,What does it mean to be feminine? 
Anthy,Girls...girls are all like the Bride of the Rose in the end.
Anthy,Did you get the letter from the Ends of the World?
Utena,Yeah. 
Anthy,"If you go to that castle, you'll meet your Prince."
Utena,"A lot has happened since I met you, hasn't it?"
Utena,Really...so many things. 
Touga,"But, is this goodbye? "
Saionji,"Sending a letter to say goodbye is ""you"" down to the last drop."
Touga,So what do you intend to do with her? 
Akio,"What do you mean, what do I intend? "
Touga,I can't imagine that Tenjou Utena would go through the Rose Gate.
Saionji,She has no reason to. 
Akio,Really? 
Touga,She didn't want to become the one to Revolutionize the World.
Touga,But you have her heart now. 
Touga,"She chose you, a real person, over her Prince."
Akio,The choice is hers. And she hasn't chosen yet.
Anthy,It seems my brother loves you too. 
Anthy,"Utena-sama, "
Anthy,I hope we can be together like this forever.
Utena,Senpai...Micky... 
Utena,I don't see the two of you together very often.
Utena,Is this another Duel challenge? 
Miki,We received letters from the Ends of the World.
Juri,They said you had been chosen as the one to Revolutionize the World.
Utena,And? 
Miki,And we wanted to know what you intend to do.
Utena,"The Power to Revolutionize the World, huh? Sounds pretty cool."
Utena,But all I'm doing is just pretending to be a Prince.
Juri,"In the end, none of us could beat you. "
Miki,Oops! 
Juri,"Thinking back, despite being a member of the Student Council, I was thinking only of myself."
Juri,"And it's pathetic, but I've got my hands full with my own problems even now."
Utena,Are you talking about Shiori-san? 
Juri,Why is it? 
Juri,Why can't I have any control over my own feelings?
Juri,What will you do about Anthy? 
Utena,What? 
Juri,"You love her, right? "
Utena,"Well...it's not like your ""love"". "
Utena,"Mine is pure, and...well, I guess yours is pure too, but..."
Utena,But I can't...Himemiya... 
Utena,any longer... 
Utena,Nanami. 
Nanami,Are you stupid or something? 
Nanami,Haven't you figured out you're being suckered yet?
Juri,"Well, that's an outfit we haven't seen in a while."
Miki,Does that mean you're quitting the Student Council?
Nanami,Hell yes. I couldn't stand doing that any longer. What a laugh.
Nanami,And you'd better quit hanging out with the Chairman and Himemiya Anthy if you know what's good foryou.
Utena,Thanks for the warning. 
Nanami,I'm serious! You're too big of a busibody! 
Nanami,You idiot! 
Utena,Doesn't warning me qualify you as a busibody too?
Nanami,I forget myself when I talk to you. 
Utena,"Well, I'm a type-B who really gets stuck on things."
Nanami,Me too. 
Miki,"Hey, Tenjou-senpai. "
Utena,What? 
Miki,I've been really worried about you lately. 
Juri,"Well well, is that a confession? "
Utena,"Miki loves Himemiya, right? "
Miki,Can't I switch over to you? 
Utena,I'll think about it. 
Juri,Could I have a picture of you too? 
Utena,What for? 
Juri,I was thinking of putting in the new pendant I just bought.
Miki,"Oh man, a strong rival just appeared. "
Nanami,"What are you, idiots? "
sign,Shadows Gathering Kashira Theater 
shadows,"I wonder I wonder, do you know what I wonder?"
shadow,I've decided to leave you now. 
shadow,My only path is that of an actress! 
shadow,Three...two...one... 
shadow,*kiss* 
shadow,"Like that, starring in a movie to break through like, boooom!"
shadow,Get into a major scandal and be in all the magazines.
shadow,"You did it, didn't you? "
shadow,"No, I haven't. Not seriously/Just licked. [Note: nameru = to lick/not to take it seriously]"
shadow,Not seriously? 
shadow,"In other words, you just want a taste of the life!"
shadow,That's exactly it! 
shadow,*KISS* 
shadow,I saw this application on your desk. You're going to take it right?
shadow,The audition? 
shadow,But a member of a student drama club like me going for a movie audition - they're all gonna laugh.
shadow,I won't laugh. 
shadow,Really? We're....really friends! 
shadows,*KISS* 
shadow,"Extra extra extra! Hey, you. "
shadow,Shall we be off? 
shadow,"Yes, Mr. Judge! "
shadow,Mr. Judge? 
shadow,The judges for the audition tomorrow...please take me to dinner!
shadow,Very well. Just leave it up to Daddy here.
shadow,Daddy? 
shadow,"I wonder, do you know that only one person will pass the audition?"
shadow,"I wonder I wonder, do you know what I wonder?"
Akio,"Does it hurt, Anthy? "
Akio,But I'm not the one causing your pain. 
Akio,It's the world. 
Utena,"Himemiya, what do you want to do in the future?"
Anthy,The future? 
Utena,After you graduate and leave here. Do you have anything you want to do?
Anthy,I can't do anything besides raise roses... 
Utena,Then how about you become a florist. 
Anthy,That sounds good. 
Anthy,"Say, Utena-sama. Have you heard of Cantarella?"
Utena,"""Cantarella""? What's that? "
Anthy,It's the name of a deadly poison that the Italian Borgia family used in the past.
Utena,Really... 
Anthy,How do you like those cookies? I baked them.
Utena,What a coincidence. 
Utena,That tea is poisoned too. 
Anthy,Really? 
Anthy,It's quite delicious. 
Utena,So are these cookies. 
Anthy,Utena-sama. 
Utena,Hmm? 
Anthy,What will you be doing in ten years? 
Utena,I dunno. But... 
Anthy,But? 
Utena,But I hope we can be together like this drinking tea then.
Anthy,Yes. I hope so too. 
Utena,I'm sure that'll be great. 
Utena,"Let's have tea and laugh together ten years from now, okay?"
Utena,Promise? 
Anthy,Yes. Definitely. 
Utena,Are you running away? 
Anthy,I can't take any more! I'm sorry! 
Anthy,Don't worry about me anymore! 
Utena,Are you running away?! 
Utena,Weren't we gonna have tea and laugh together for our ten-year reunion?
Anthy,"I'm sorry, Utena-sama. "
Anthy,I'm so sorry. 
Touga,I didn't think you'd go. 
Touga,Do you want to meet your Prince that badly?
Utena,That's not all. 
Saionji,"Then, for what? "
Touga,Is it for Himemiya? 
Touga,He who believes friendship exists is a fool.
Utena,Didn't you know? I am a fool. 
Anthy,"""The time is ripe. The time to pass through the Rose Gate,"
Anthy,"when the path to the Castle is opened, "
Anthy,and you shall receive the Power to Revolutionize the World.
Anthy,"And there, we shall meet again. "
Anthy,"From your Prince."" "
Anthy,Utena-sama. You can still turn back. 
Utena,Let's go.
