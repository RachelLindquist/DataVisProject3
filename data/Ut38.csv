title,"""The Ends of the World"""
Utena,Where are we? 
Utena,The Prince... 
Akio,Yes. The Prince. 
Utena,"So, you were the Ends of the World after all, huh?"
Utena,You're the one who was behind everything. 
Akio,You knew all along. 
Akio,"But, I'm your Prince. You came all this way to meet me."
Utena,I want to know your reason. 
Akio,Reason? 
Utena,The reason behind making everybody Duel!
Utena,What is the meaning of all the things being done at this school?
Akio,How courageous. 
Akio,What sort of dreams have you been dreaming lately?
Akio,I always dream of the castle. 
Utena,The castle? 
Akio,Yes. The castle where the Prince and the princess will live...
Akio,...happily for ever and ever and ever after.
Akio,The Prince is me. And the princess is you.
Utena,Himemiya! 
Akio,You needn't be alarmed. Anthy is right over there.
Akio,That ring would have lead you here sooner or later.
Akio,"You truly have done well, coming all this distance without losing your noble heart."
Akio,My judgement was sound. 
Akio,You're beautiful. 
Akio,Bearing your noble heart all the way here...
Akio,You are my true princess. 
Akio,Swords no longer suit you. 
Akio,"I shall keep this sword. And from this day forward, I will protect you."
Utena,And what happens then? 
Akio,You'll be happy. You'll receive eternity and we will love each other forever.
Akio,And the princess will live forever and ever with the Prince in the castle.
Akio,What's wrong? 
Utena,"If we live happily in the castle, what'll happen to Himemiya?"
Akio,She'll remain the Rose Bride. Forever. 
Utena,Are you running away? 
Anthy,Don't worry about me anymore! 
Utena,Are you running away?! 
Utena,Weren't we gonna have tea and laugh together for our ten-year reunion?
Anthy,"I'm sorry, Utena-sama. "
Anthy,I'm so sorry. 
Anthy,Because I'm the Rose Bride...because I'm a doll with no heart...
Anthy,"I thought that no matter what befell my body, my heart wouldn't feel the pain."
Anthy,"I'm sorry, Utena-sama. My suffering is my rightful punishment as the Rose Bride."
Anthy,But...making you suffer...you were merely caught up in it all...
Anthy,I knew everything. 
Anthy,I exploited your innocence. I encroached upon your kindness.
Anthy,"I'm sorry, Utena-sama. I've been unfair to you."
Anthy,I'm a dirty woman. I've betrayed you all along. I-
Utena,No. 
Utena,I...didn't recognize your pain. 
Utena,I didn't realize your suffering. 
Utena,"Instead, I just kept on pretending to be the Prince who could save you."
Utena,I was just being conceited about protecting you.
Utena,And when I saw you and Akio-san together...I even thought you had betrayed me.
Utena,When you were suffering so much...when I had said we should save each other...
Utena,I'M the one who's unfair. I'm the one who's dirty.
Utena,I'm the one who betrayed you. 
Anthy,"It's okay now, so please...leave this school."
Anthy,Please forget about all of this. 
Utena,How...the hell could I do that? 
Utena,That's right. There's no way in hell I can do that.
Akio,What're you doing? 
Akio,A sword isn't meant for a girl to wave around like that.
Utena,I'll free Himemiya from you! 
Akio,Truly courageous. 
Akio,Who would have thought it would come to this?
Utena,What're you talking about? 
Akio,"But, just as I once said, now that time has passed..."
Akio,...you should no longer be just a pure soul who wants to be a Prince.
Akio,Dresses don't go with swords. 
Akio,Looking at you reminds me of my former self.
Akio,"But, that's exactly why you can't save her."
Akio,"In the end, all that stuff about the Prince and the castle holding eternity is merely make-believe."
Akio,"Now, allow me to show you what's real. "
Utena,Real? 
Akio,The Ends of the World. 
Utena,This is... 
Utena,your room! 
Akio,"A magnificent Planetarium, isn't it? "
Akio,This device paints the illusion of fairy tales for those with naive wishes in their hearts...
Akio,"...who say they wish something eternal existed, who say they wish the power of miracles existed."
Akio,"But, there's no place higher than this room."
Akio,"This room is the summit of Ohtori Academy, and of the world."
Utena,I hate this room. 
Akio,Someone as young as you might not appreciate the value of this room.
Akio,"And so instead of the real Chairman's Room, you chase after phantom Castles in the sky."
Utena,That's not it. This is the room where you and Anthy always...
Akio,Always...? 
Akio,"Oh, is that what you're upset about?"
Akio,Am I really doing something that despicable?
Akio,"And even if I am, you're the same as me."
Utena,What're you talking about? 
Akio,I doubt you've forgotten. 
Akio,"Behold, the memory of the two of us. "
Akio,"I have a fiancee, but that didn't stop you."
Akio,Isn't that a sin? 
Utena,That's not fair. 
Akio,Unfair? Isn't it unfair to turn your eyes from the truth and then criticize others?
Akio,Isn't it UNFAIR to pretend that your conscience is clear and that YOU'RE the one in the right?
Utena,That's not it! I...Himemiya... 
Akio,That's right. You didn't even try to understand Anthy.
Akio,"In the end, you had your hands full just thinking about yourself."
Akio,How cute. You're a good woman. 
Akio,You should stay a girl. 
Akio,"There was a time when you were helpless and reality subjugated you,"
Akio,no matter how much you struggled. 
Akio,"With no way to escape the cruel reality before your eyes,"
Akio,you tried to segregate yourself from the world.
Akio,The one who saved you from within that darkness...was me.
Akio,I'm the one who gave you the power to face the world again.
Akio,"At that time, I was a Prince to you. "
Akio,"But, I'm the same, then and now. "
Akio,"And Anthy was the Rose Bride, then and now."
Akio,And she's a witch. 
Akio,"That goes for you too. Both then and now, you're a girl."
Akio,There's no need for you to fight with a sword in your hand.
Akio,"You can become a noble, beautiful princess. "
Akio,"Now, won't you give me that sword? "
Utena,What do you plan to do with this sword? 
Akio,I'll Revolutionize the World. 
Utena,Aren't you her brother?! 
Utena,Are you just going to abandon her? 
Akio,Foolish lifeform. 
Akio,There never was any such thing as a Prince anywhere in the world in the first place.
Utena,Didn't you just say you were a Prince? 
Akio,Do you know what that is? 
Akio,"It's Dios's, the Prince's Grave. "
Akio,"When she became known as a witch, Dios perished."
Akio,The Princely me no longer exists. 
Utena,I guess I have no choice but to fight with you.
Akio,For Anthy? 
Akio,"I thought that she was a goddess who sacrificed her body for the one she loved, for me."
Akio,I once thought so too. 
Akio,"And she really might have been, once. But now she's a witch."
Akio,And she enjoys being a witch. 
Utena,You're the one who's making her a witch! 
Akio,Wrong. We love each other. She can't be happy any other way.
Touga,"If it does not break the egg's shell, "
Touga,the chick will die without being born. 
Miki,We are the chick. 
Juri,The egg is the world. 
Nanami,"If we do not break the shell of the world,"
Nanami,we will die without being born. 
Saionji,Break the shell of the world. 
all,To Revolutionize the World! 
Miki,"It's begun, hasn't it. "
Juri,Yeah. 
Nanami,Tenjou Utena. 
Saionji,That's right. 
Nanami,"So, what happens to the Victor of this game?"
Touga,Nobody knows. But it will be her final trial.
Touga,The Duel Called Revolution has now begun.
Akio,I'm not a Duelist. 
Akio,Fighting me isn't some play duel. 
Utena,I was never playing when I dueled! 
Akio,"No, you know nothing besides play duels. "
Akio,"But if you don't put up your sword now, you'll find out how terrifying real duels are."
Utena,I won't let you beat me. 
Akio,A child like you can't appreciate my ideals.
Akio,The Rose Bride exists because of ideals you don't comprehend.
Utena,What kind of shitty ideal makes you use this room to control everybody's lives?!
Akio,A child wouldn't appreciate the value of this room.
Utena,What is the value of this room?! 
Utena,Making Himemiya suffer more?! 
Akio,She's the Rose Bride of her own free will.
Akio,There's no call for you to interfere. 
Anthy,"I am the Rose Bride...from today forward, I am your flower."
Anthy,"Really, I... "
Anthy,"I'm sorry, Utena-sama. "
Anthy,I'm so sorry. 
Utena,I'll be the one to free her from you! 
Akio,Do you know what you're saying? 
Utena,Sure I do! It means I'll become a Prince! 
Utena,Why...? 
Utena,Himemiya...why...
