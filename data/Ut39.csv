Utena,Why...
Utena,Why... 
Anthy,You remind me of the Dios I once loved. 
Anthy,But you can't become my Prince. 
Anthy,Because you're a girl. 
Utena,Hime...Himemiya... 
Akio,I told you this wasn't a game. 
Saionji,The Duel Called Revolution...huh? 
Touga,Don't remove that yet. 
Touga,"As the representative of all us Duelists, she's entered the Duel Arena."
Touga,"Until all is decided, we all must remain Duelists."
Nanami,I already took mine off. 
Nanami,We should all just hurry up and forget all this.
Miki,I wonder if this is the sort of thing that can be forgotten.
Juri,Come to think of it...I've forgotten that boy's name.
Miki,"""That boy""? "
Juri,"Long ago, when my older sister was still a child, she nearly drowned in a river."
Juri,"On that day, there was a boy who jumped into the river to try to save her."
Nanami,And? 
Juri,"My sister got lucky and was saved by a nearby adult, but..."
Juri,the boy who tried to save my sister and jumped into the river was swept away.
Nanami,Did he die? 
Juri,I thought my sister was very cold for forgetting his name so quickly...
Juri,"But now that I try to remember, it seems I've forgotten it too."
Nanami,Hey... 
Nanami,Hey... 
Nanami,Why'd you tell us that now? 
Akio,"Anthy, the sword. "
Akio,What is it? What're you waiting for? 
Anthy,I... 
Akio,Are you regretting what you've done? 
Akio,We had to subject your friend to misfortune after all.
Akio,Yes. It's all my fault. Do you hate me now?
Akio,"Maybe if I tried to be a Prince like in the old days, noone would have had to suffer."
Akio,"I always feel your wounds, your suffering, with my own body."
Anthy,"You are he who chose this road, knowing the whole of the world."
Akio,"Knowing the whole of you, I love you. "
Anthy,"Yes, brother. "
Akio,"Anthy, the sword. "
Akio,"That's right. You're a good girl, Anthy. "
Akio,The Rose Gate. The doorway which seals the Power to Revolutionize the World.
Akio,They've come. 
Akio,Anthy! 
Utena,Hime...miya...you mustn't...Hi...me... 
Anthy,"My meddlesome hero. Thanks for a small taste of what you call ""friendship""."
Anthy,Farewell. 
Utena,You...mustn't...Hime...miya...Hime... 
Akio,The Million Swords that shine with people's hatred.
Akio,They stir at the sight of this Prince's sword.
swords,The witch...the witch...the witch...witch...accursed witch...witch...
Utena,Himemiya....Himemiya! 
Akio,Drawing the swords from the Prince to herself.
Akio,That is the Rose Bride's destiny. 
Akio,Anthy wished for it all herself. 
Utena,Himemiya. Himemiya! 
Utena,Himemiya...Himemiya! 
Utena,HIMEMIYA!! 
Akio,The time has come to break the seal. 
Akio,The time has come to open the door to a new world.
Utena,Akio-san...save Himemiya. 
Utena,Akio-san! 
Utena,Hey...save her... 
Utena,Save...Himemiya... 
Dios,You should't move. I'll tend to your wounds later.
Dios,Such a gentle child. Are you crying? 
Dios,Do you see the rose-shaped gate over there?
Dios,"Within that gate is that which is eternal, something shining, the power of miracles."
Dios,"With that power, anything is possible. "
Dios,"You can't do it. You're a girl, aren't you?"
Dios,"Besides, you don't have power. With power, anything is possible."
Dios,You can even free her from her fate. 
Dios,But how the power is used... 
Akio,...is my decision. 
Dios,Don't look so miserable. 
Dios,"You've tried so hard until now, you needn't blame yourself."
Dios,You've treasured your Rose Signet until now.
Dios,I shall give you a kiss as your reward. 
Dios,This is your consolation. 
Akio,"Once again, even this sword fails? "
Akio,"Tell me, when will I ever recover the Power of Dios?"
Akio,"Well, no matter. The Rose Bride is mine. "
Akio,I can always- 
Akio,I'm amazed you managed to stand up. 
Akio,Don't tell me you seriously intend to open this gate?
Akio,Don't bother. The Prince's sword is already broken.
Akio,The seal can no longer... 
Akio,The seal can't be broken. It's impossible for you.
Akio,I defeated you and... 
Akio,Very well. 
Akio,Suit yourself. 
Utena,Himemiya! 
Utena,Himemiya!! 
Akio,She certainly resembles the old me. 
Akio,I used to be like that. 
Akio,I used to think that sincerity was valuable... 
Akio,...and that it was the one and only way to change the world.
Akio,But sincerity by itself changes nothing. 
Akio,"Without power, one finds themself merely depending on others to live."
Akio,I've taken enough risks to buy the power to change the world.
Akio,That's how the world works- 
Utena,Shut up!! 
Utena,Himemiya...you don't know... 
Utena,...how happy I was...just being together with you...
Akio,Wh...what the?! 
Akio,The swords! 
Akio,That's the... 
Akio,STOP IT!! 
Akio,Don't open that! You don't know what'll happen!
Akio,STOP!! 
Akio,Stop... 
Utena,Himemiya...Himemiya... 
Anthy,Who are you? 
Utena,I came to save you. 
Anthy,"But, you're a... "
Utena,I came here to meet you. 
Utena,So don't be afraid of this world where we'll meet.
Utena,...Himemiya...Himemiya...Himemiya! 
Utena,Himemiya! 
Anthy,Utena...sama...? 
Utena,Himemiya...we finally...meet. 
Anthy,Utena-sama! 
Anthy,Utena-sama! 
Utena,Himemiya...take my hand! 
Anthy,You mustn't! Hurry and run away! The swords are...
Utena,"Take my hand! Come on, Himemiya! "
Anthy,You don't understand! If you don't run quickly...
Utena,"Himemiya! Hurry, take my hand! "
Anthy,I beg you. 
Utena,Hurry! Hurry up and take my hand! 
Utena,"Someday...someday, the two of us... "
Utena,I really...couldn't become a Prince. 
Utena,"I'm sorry, Himemiya. Sorry for ending up just a make-believe Prince..."
Utena,Forgive me. 
Wakaba,I guess Utena's not here. And here I wanted to do homework together.
shadow,What're you gonna do when you graduate? 
shadow,"I'm going to high school, of course. "
shadow,"No, I mean in your future. "
shadow,Haven't decided yet. 
shadow,I wanna be an actress. 
shadow,Do you really believe you can pull that off?
shadow,"Man, you're dead serious about becoming one."
shadow,"Well, look forward to our ten year reunion."
shadow,Hey... 
shadow,And what about you? 
shadow,What about? 
shadow,Your future. 
shadow,I guess I'll get married to some high-ranking man.
shadow,There she goes. 
shadow,There she goes. 
shadow,"Hey, aren't women supposed to be good at nabbing handsome guys?"
shadow,Get a load of this! 
shadow,This little tramp just started going out with the man of her dreams.
shadow,"She's the one who kept going ""Utena-sama, Utena-sama"" all the time."
shadow,"Hey, you got a problem with that? "
shadow,"Hey, who was Utena-sama again? "
shadow,"What, don't you know? "
shadow,Remember? She's that girl who always dressed like a guy.
shadow,She got hassled by the teachers all the time.
shadow,"Oh, now I remember. Her! "
shadow,But didn't she get hurt real bad and hospitalized a month or two ago?
shadow,Huh? Hospitalized? I heard she got betrayed by a friend or a lover or something and switched schools.
shadow,I heard she got in trouble with the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and expelled.
shadow,"Well, not like it matters. "
Kozue,"That's the timing, got it? "
Tsuwabuki,Yes! 
Miki,You'll assist me with my job from next term on.
Touga,I hear you're taking more classes in your major lately.
Saionji,I wanted to get back the stuff I'd lost when I was playing.
Touga,"Playing, huh? "
Nanami,Tea's ready. 
Saionji,Thanks. 
Touga,We'll be right there. 
Juri,Next! 
Shiori,Yes! 
Wakaba,Such nice weather. 
girl,Wa-ka-ba! 
girl,"You got me, your bestest friend in the whole world a birthday present, right?!"
Akio,"It hasn't been that long since then, but everybody's forgotten about her completely."
Akio,She didn't cause a Revolution after all.
Akio,"Now that she's gone, she was just a dropout to this world."
Akio,I've got to rebuild the Code of the Rose Signet from scratch.
Akio,"I'm counting on you, Anthy. "
Anthy,"You don't know what happened, do you? "
Akio,What? 
Anthy,"It's alright now. Please go on playing make-believe ""Prince"" in this comfortable little coffin forever."
Anthy,But I must go. 
Akio,Go? To where? 
Anthy,That person hasn't vanished. She's merely left your world.
Akio,What're you talking about? 
Akio,W-wait a minute! Anthy! 
Akio,Anthy!! 
Anthy,Farewell. 
Anthy,Now it's my turn to go to you. 
Anthy,"No matter where you are, I'll find you for sure."
Anthy,"Wait for me, Utena. "
Utena,"Hey, if anything is troubling you, tell me about it."
Utena,I want to be your friend. 
Utena,"And someday, with me... "
Anthy,"Someday, with you? "
text,"""Someday, Shine With Me"""
