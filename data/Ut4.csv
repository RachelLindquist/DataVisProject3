Utena,"So it's come to this, Micky... "
Miki,Yes. 
Miki,I have to get that music back. 
Miki,"Therefore, whatever it takes, I must have the Bride."
Utena,It suits you better to sit down at the piano.
Juri,Definitely. 
Miki,"The Rose Bride will be mine, "
Miki,even if I have to hurt you! 
Nanami,"You play the piano so wonderfully, Miki."
Nanami,You're the pride of our academy. 
Nanami,It was your performance that added grace to the party the other day.
Nanami,But why did you give up on the idea of entering the contest?
Nanami,The teachers were disappointed. 
Miki,This piano seems a bit out of tune. 
Nanami,Does it? 
Nanami,It was just tuned last week. 
Miki,"Well, then maybe it's me that needs tuning."
Nanami,"You always play this piece when you're alone, don't you?"
Miki,This piece is my only reason for playing the piano.
Miki,I keep playing because I want a certain someone to hear this music.
Nanami,A certain someone? 
Miki,"But, I can't play this piece quite the way I'd like."
Miki,"No matter what I do, it just doesn't sound like it should."
Nanami,How could that be? 
Nanami,It sounds just fine to me. 
Nanami,The sound conveys your feelings well enough.
Miki,No one can play this piece without eternal beauty within themselves.
Nanami,And what's it called? 
Miki,"""The Sunny Garden"" "
Title,The Sunny Garden - Prelude - 
Wakaba,Oh no! This is my worst score ever! 
Utena,"Yeah, that's too bad. "
Wakaba,"Well, it's okay if we just learn the basic multiplication tables."
Utena,I think we were supposed to learn logical reasoning.
Wakaba,"But my mama told me, "
Wakaba,"""Ladies leave all the logical thinking to the men."""
Utena,I see. 
Wakaba,You'll do fine since you're good at math.
Wakaba,No way! 
Wakaba,You were never this bad at math! 
Utena,I was a bit distracted. 
Wakaba,"Oh no, you must study logical reasoning. "
Utena,Hey... 
Utena,I can't get excited about this score anyway.
Wakaba,That's too bad. 
GirlStude,"You DO know how much we love Micky, don't you?"
GirlStude,We heard all about it. 
GirlStude,"Because of you, our Micky gave up the idea of entering the contest."
Anthy,I... 
Anthy,had no idea. 
GirlStude,Liar. 
GirlStude,You must have said something to discourage him.
GirlStude,Right. 
Anthy,I never said anything like that! 
Miki,What are you guys doing? 
Miki,It seems they were falsely accusing you because of me.
Miki,I am truly sorry about this. 
Anthy,Thank you. 
Miki,Not at all. 
Utena,Oh! 
Wakaba,What? 
Utena,Who's that boy with Himemiya? 
Wakaba,"Oh, that's Micky! "
Utena,Micky? 
Wakaba,You don't know him? 
Wakaba,He's 7th grader Kaoru Miki-kun. 
Wakaba,"Not only is he ranked nationally in piano and fencing,"
Wakaba,"he's a beautiful genius takes university courses, even though he's only in 7th grade."
Wakaba,"Plus, he's really popular with the older girls."
Wakaba,Mitsuko and her friends are always talking about him.
Wakaba,But... 
Wakaba,I wonder why he's with Himemiya Anthy. 
Juri,Hi. 
Miki,Juri-sempai. 
Juri,"I thought I'd find you in the club room or the Student Council office,"
Juri,but here you are studying in the library. 
Juri,Are you correcting someone's test? 
Miki,"Yes, sort of. "
Juri,"Well, that's a change. You usually keep your distance from others."
Miki,"Say, Juri-sempai... "
Miki,"Do you suppose happiness is something close to us, after all?"
Juri,"Anyway, this answer sheet is terrible! "
Juri,Whose is it? 
Miki,"Well, I looked it over. "
Miki,That teacher always gives tricky questions like this.
Miki,Try to keep that in mind next time. 
Utena,"Must be nice, getting your test corrected... "
Utena,Guess what I need is a logical boyfriend. 
Miki,Tenjou-sempai... 
Miki,I'm Kaoru Miki. 
Miki,Nice to meet you. 
Utena,You know me? 
Miki,Of course. 
Miki,"You're now the most famous among us, after all."
Utena,Us? 
Miki,This. 
Utena,"Oh, then you're one of those Student Council guys?"
Utena,"Then you must be after the Rose Bride, too."
Miki,"No, please don't get the wrong idea. "
Miki,"I am a member of the Student Council, "
Miki,but I have no intention of winning Himemiya-san as my bride by a duel.
Miki,I swear! 
Miki,These are the problems I expect for the make-up test.
Miki,"If you can memorize the formulas in this notebook, I'm sure you can pass."
Anthy,Thank you. 
Miki,Not at all. 
Utena,"Well, it looks like you're awfully concerned about her."
Miki,She... 
Miki,"I mean, Himemiya-san... "
Miki,looks a little like someone I know. 
Miki,That's all. 
Miki,"I have no intention of challenging you to a duel, Tenjou-sempai."
Utena,Of course! 
Utena,Do you know how much trouble you Student Council guys have caused us?
Utena,"I don't quite know what's going on, but by involving us in stupid things like duels,"
Utena,we have to retake the test. 
Miki,"""We,"" you say? "
Miki,"You have to retake the test, too? "
Utena,Um... well... yes. 
Touga,"That sounds good, today. "
Touga,"It's not your usual strong, controlling technique."
Touga,"It sounds more mellifluous, somehow. "
Touga,"Did you ever find that ""glow"" you were talking about earlier?"
Miki,"Yes, I just might have. "
Miki,I might finally be able to recover something I'd lost long ago.
Touga,I envy you. 
Touga,"When you recover it, be sure to let me know."
Nanami,"What's this ""glow?"" "
A-ko,"I wonder, I wonder... Do you know what I wonder?"
B-ko,"In elementary school, my first boyfriend was the best math student in class."
A-ko,"Oh, I never knew. Even then you had a boyfriend?"
B-ko,But... 
B-ko,when he found out that pro wrestling 
B-ko,and super sized garlic ramen 
B-ko,were my favorites... 
A-ko,"""Now I know what kind of girl you are,"""
B-ko,"he said, and with that it was over. "
A-ko,"Oh, women in love, you young people dreaming of love..."
B-ko,Are you aware of... 
A-ko,...love's true colors? 
A-ko&B-ko,"I wonder, I wonder... Do you know what I wonder?"
Utena,Coming! 
Miki,Sorry I'm late. 
Utena,"Hi, we've been waiting for you. "
Utena,Come on in. 
Miki,"Well, actually... "
Nanami,Would you mind if I joined you? 
Utena,"Oh, you must be... "
Nanami,I'm Nanami. 
Utena,Miki's girlfriend? 
Miki,"No, no way! "
Utena,"Well, come on in. "
Utena,Himemiya is waiting inside. 
Miki,Thanks for having us over. 
Nanami,"Yes, thank you. "
Miki,"Huh, they say this dorm is haunted, but it's actually quite nice inside."
Nanami,You have such a nice room. 
Utena,"Yeah, Himemiya cleans up religiously everyday."
Miki,"Himemiya-san must really like to keep things neat, then."
Nanami,"Wow, I'm really impressed. "
Nanami,"Ok, just watch. "
Nanami,Think Himemiya Anthy's a cute girl while you can.
Miki,"I envy you, Tenjou-sempai, living with such a feminine girl."
Utena,Is that sarcasm? 
Nanami,"Himemiya-sempai, may I borrow your eraser?"
Nanami,"A snail, it's a snail! "
Nanami,She has a snail in her pencil case! 
Utena,Himemiya! I've misjudged you! 
Miki,My image of you is ruined! 
Nanami,"This is the end for you, Himemiya Anthy!"
Nanami,That's what's going to happen. 
Nanami,"Namely, Operation ""Oh my gosh, Himemiya Anthy's a weirdo keeping a snail in her pencil case!"""
Miki,Did you say something? 
Nanami,"No, nothing. "
Miki,Then let's begin with the monomial expressions.
Miki,It's all right. If you remember how to do it it's like a puzzle.
Nanami,"Himemiya-sempai, may I borrow your eraser?"
Nanami,"Himemiya Anthy, prepare yourself. "
Nanami,Sn- sn- sn- snails! There's snails in here!
Anthy,"Oh, that's a house for my snail friends. "
Utena,I always tell her not to keep them there.
Miki,But it's cute. It's something I'd expect from Himemiya-san.
Nanami,"They're snails! You say it's cute, but they're snails!"
Anthy,"Catherine, Juliet, Marcelina, I'll see you later."
Miki,"Do you get it, Tenjou-sempai? "
Miki,You made a mistake right here. 
Utena,Huh? Where? 
Miki,In this case... 
Nanami,"Well then, I have no other choice. "
Miki,"Look, you made the same mistake as before."
Nanami,"Oh, what a cute desk! I want a desk like this, too!"
Nanami,A snake! There's a snake in here! 
Nanami,She's got a snake in the drawer! 
Utena,Himemiya! I misjudged you! 
Miki,My image of you is ruined! 
Nanami,"At last! This is the end for you, Himemiya Anthy!"
Nanami,That's what's going to happen! 
Nanami,"Namely, Operation ""Oh my gosh, Himemiya Anthy's a weirdo keeping a snake in her drawer!"""
Miki,Did you say something? 
Nanami,"No, nothing. "
Utena,"In triangle ACP, segment BX is parallel to segment CP so,"
Nanami,"Oh, what a cute desk! I want a desk like this, too!"
Nanami,My snake... 
Nanami,the snake that I spent all night trying to catch...
Anthy,"Oh, that's Mr. Mongoose's home. "
Utena,I always tell her not to keep it there.
Miki,But it's cute. It's something I'd expect from Himemiya-san.
Nanami,It's a mongoose! A mongoose! Don't you think that's weird?
Anthy,"We're studying now, so I'll see you later, okay?"
Anthy,Mr. Snake tasted yummy? I see... 
Utena,How do you do this one? 
Miki,"Oh, like this... "
Utena,"Oh, I see. "
Miki,Finished? 
Nanami,"I see, I see how it is. "
Nanami,"Okay, I didn't want to do this, but you leave me no choice."
Nanami,A live octopus! There's a live octopus in here!
Nanami,She keeps a live octopus in the closet!
Utena,Himemiya! I misjudged you! 
Miki,My image of you is ruined! 
Nanami,"This is really the end for you, Himemiya Anthy!"
Nanami,That's definitely what's going to happen!
Nanami,"Namely, Operation ""Oh my gosh, Himemiya Anthy's a weirdo keeping a live octopus in her closet!"""
Miki,Did you say something? 
Nanami,"No, nothing. "
Nanami,"This time for sure, using this live octopus,"
Nanami,I'll have you begging for mercy! 
Nanami,"Himemiya Anthy, my live octopus will have you begging for mercy."
Nanami,Here goes... 
Nanami,"A live octopus, a live octopus, a live octopus, a live octopus, a live octopu------s!"
Utena,I wouldn't open that if I were you. 
Nanami,"This can't be true, it must be a dream."
Nanami,This huge live octopus and its octopus tentacles...
Miki,"Hey, isn't that the ad balloon we used in last year's school festival?"
Anthy,"I felt sorry for it getting thrown away, so I hid it here."
Utena,Won't you please convince her to get rid of it?
Miki,But it's cute. It's something I'd expect from Himemiya-san.
Miki,"So, this becomes ""X=3."" "
Miki,"And if you substitute it in here, you can solve this linear problem."
Utena,"Oh, now I see! "
Utena,3+Y is um... 
Utena,and so... 
Utena,Aha! I've got it! How's this? 
Miki,Correct. 
Utena,I see. You ARE a super genius. 
Utena,Your tutoring is easier to understand than the class.
Miki,"Oh, please... "
Utena,Let's get serious. The make up test is next week.
Anthy,"Yes, Utena-sama. "
Utena,It's been this long already? 
Utena,Miki-kun? 
Miki,Yes? 
Utena,Why don't we grab a bite to eat? 
Utena,"What about you, Nanami-kun? "
Miki,Nanami-kun? 
Nanami,"Huh? Oh, yes, dinner. "
Nanami,"Actually, I packed a little something... "
Nanami,I hope you all like it. 
Nanami,Another animal... 
Nanami,"Another one of Himemiya- sempai's friends, huh?"
Anthy,Chuchu! You shouldn't do that! 
Nanami,These animals... 
Anthy,I'm sorry. I'll go make something else to eat.
Anthy,Lemon and strawberry taste pretty good together!
Utena,Really? 
Miki,"Oh, this is really delicious! "
Anthy,It's my special recipe. 
Miki,Really? I'd better make a note of that.
Utena,I'd like a bit more syrup. 
Anthy,"Nanami-san, have some before it melts. "
Nanami,You've got to be kidding me... 
Miki,How rude of you to speak that way in front of your elders!
Nanami,"Snails in the pencil case, a mongoose in the drawer, an octopus balloon in the closet..."
Nanami,"And now on top of all that, shaved ice for supper!"
Nanami,It's bad for my stomach! 
Nanami,I have a delicate stomach! 
Miki,But I like shaved ice... 
Utena,It's a shame you've got a delicate stomach.
Nanami,I'm not talking about shaved ice or my stomach!
Nanami,Why are you guys so taken with her! 
Miki,Didn't you say you wanted to be her friend?
Nanami,"What's that, you say? "
Nanami,"YOU'RE the one who likes her, Miki. "
Nanami,Confess! 
Miki,Well... 
Utena,Huh? 
Utena,Himemiya's gone. 
Miki,You're right. 
Utena,Maybe I shouldn't have forced her to have this study meeting.
Anthy,Maybe takoyaki would have been better for dinner...
Utena,I'll look for her. 
Miki,I'm coming too. 
Miki,It's the piano... 
Nanami,That's the song you're always playing. 
Utena,"Ah, so Himemiya can play piano... "
Miki,She plays just like my sister... 
Miki,That sunny garden. 
Miki,I've found it... 
Miki,"I've found the ""glow!"" "
