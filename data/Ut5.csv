girl,"1 Hey, hey! Look! This is amazing! "
girl,2 What's amazing? 
girl,1 Look! Captain Juri and Micky! 
girl,"3 It's amazing, all right! "
girl,1 Didn't I tell you it was amazing? 
girl,3 Too amazing! 
girl,"1 That's to be expected, though. "
girl,1 They're both national level players. 
girl,"2 Ah, that figures. "
girl,"1 Hey, hey, by the way... "
girls,We saw it! It was amazing! Cool! 
Juri,"Well, you've finally defeated me. "
Juri,You've improved. 
Miki,"No, I'm not good enough. "
Miki,I've yet to reach perfection. 
Juri,"Well, imperfection IS your strength. "
Juri,It's a power because of your purity. 
Juri,Your sword always has the force of your sincerity.
Juri,"And today, it seems to be stronger than ever."
Juri,Is it because of the girl whose answer sheet you're correcting?
Miki,Wh-what are you talking about? 
Juri,"But, I don't think your sword is meant for real fighting."
Title,The Sunny Garden - Finale - 
Miki,Here you are. 
Anthy,Thank you. 
Miki,This looks like that garden. 
Utena,"Hey, Chuchu, wait! "
Utena,Oops. Guess I'm not wanted here. 
Miki,The sound... 
Miki,The sound that I've been seeking... 
Utena,"This is the same music Himemiya was playing last night, isn't it?"
Miki,Yes. 
Miki,"It's ""The Sunny Garden,"" which my sister and I wrote when we were very young."
Utena,"You wrote it? But it's a famous composition, isn't it?"
Miki,My twin sister and I used to play with the piano like a toy since we were old enough to understand suchthings...
Miki,In that garden... 
Miki,Our playing always used to surprise the grown-ups in the neighborhood.
Utena,"So, you siblings were both child geniuses. "
Miki,Now I realize that all of my happiness rested in that garden. But...
Miki,But... 
Utena,But? 
Miki,But I ruined it. 
Miki,I ruined it all by myself! 
Kozue,A concert? 
Miki,"Yup. Next Thursday, everyone's coming to see us."
Kozue,"But, going out in front of all those strangers..."
Kozue,All those strangers scare me. 
Miki,"It'll be okay, really. I'll be right there with you."
Miki,"All you have to do is to play the piano with me, just like we always have."
Miki,There's nothing to be afraid of. 
Doctor,He has the measles. 
Doctor,"Well, one week of bedrest and he should be fine."
Man,"Okay, dear, it's time to go to the concert hall."
Man,"Everyone's been waiting. Give it your best shot for your brother's sake, okay?"
Sis,Onii-chan! 
Sis,onii-chan... onii-chan... 
Sis,onii-chan... onii-chan... 
Sis,ONII-CHA-----N! 
Man,"Without warning, she fled the stage and hid herself until dark."
Man,For some time after that she wouldn't say a word.
Miki,"After that, she stopped playing the piano."
Miki,"Until then, I had never realized how much I loved her piano..."
Miki,and how much I loved that garden. 
Miki,"No matter how much my technique improved, "
Miki,I could never capture that quality of her playing.
Miki,And that's all I continue to play for. 
Miki,But HER playing... Himemiya-san's has it.
Utena,"So you're the ""Love is blind"" type, then."
Miki,"I've finally found my ""glow."" "
Utena,"Is that supposed to be a confession of love, then?"
Utena,"How about it, Himemiya? "
Utena,Do you like younger boys? 
Anthy,"Well, I am your bride, Utena-sama. "
Utena,"Hey, Himemiya. Would you stop saying ""I am your bride, Utena-sama"" all the time?"
Anthy,"But still, I am engaged to you, Utena-sama. "
Utena,Now look! 
Utena,It's not like I agreed that you're my bride!
Utena,It's crazy to make a girl a bride of the winner of a duel.
Utena,I won't stand for a system that ignores a person's personality!
touga,"If the egg's shell does not break, the chick will die without being born."
touga,We are the chick; the egg is the world. 
touga,"If the world's shell does not break, we will die without being born."
touga,Break the world's shell! 
"touga,juri",For the sake of revolutionizing the world!
Juri,What is today's meeting for? 
Juri,"A letter from the Ends of the World hasn't arrived yet, has it?"
Touga,Well... 
Touga,We have all been meeting and carrying out the letters' instructions.
Touga,"But today, an urgent motion was made. "
Miki,The urgent motion is this: I propose the dissolution of the Student Council.
Touga,This is rather sudden... 
Miki,It's ridiculous to try to win Himemiya-san with the Duels.
Miki,I think this kind of thing should not be allowed after all.
Miki,"No matter how great the power we might receive, this system,"
Miki,"which can disregard Himemiya Anthy's very personality, should not be tolerated."
Juri,Love changes a person. 
Juri,I see. 
Juri,It was HER exam paper that you corrected... 
Touga,Sometimes youthfulness is such an obstacle 
Touga,that you can't see what you want. 
Miki,But isn't all we're doing just ruining something vital to humanity anyway?
Juri,Break the world's shell. 
Juri,...for the sake of revolutionizing the world.
Kozue,Ow... 
Kozue,Oh! 
Kozue,That wasn't very friendly. 
Miki,Get out of my way. 
Kozue,You dropped your score book. 
Kozue,"So, should we give it another try? "
Miki,I expect nothing of you. 
Miki,As if you had the will to play. What are you doing here?
Kozue,"Nothing special... but, I'm free to do what I want."
Kozue,The music classroom isn't just for playing with the piano.
girl,Morning! How are you? 
Kozue,Morning! I'm fine. 
Touga,"Morning, Kaoru Miki-kun. "
Touga,Your sister is as pretty as you are. 
Touga,And just as agreeable... 
Anthy,Good morning. 
Touja,"If something is really important to you, seize it and protect it with your own hands,"
Touja,"lest someone should steal it, Micky. "
Touja,"Even if the Student Council were dissolved, there'd still be Duelists after the Rose Bride."
Touja,Only the one who is engaged to her can do as he pleases with her.
Miki,"""Do as he pleases..."" "
Miki,"""Do as he pleases..."" "
Miki,"Himemiya-san, when did you start playing the piano?"
Anthy,I don't know. It was too long ago to remember very clearly.
Miki,Really? 
Miki,You must have been as cute as an angel when you were very young.
Miki,My sister's piano was really wonderful. 
Miki,I won't lose it this time. 
Miki,I swear it! 
Miki,Do you like playing the piano? 
Anthy,Yes. 
Miki,Would you play for me again? 
Anthy,If Utena-sama allows me... 
Miki,How about tomorrow? 
Anthy,If Utena-sama allows me... 
Miki,"Well, is Tenjou-sempai's permission required for everything you do?"
Anthy,"Certainly, since I am the Rose Bride. "
Miki,Well then... 
Miki,"if Tenjou-sempai told you to quit the piano, would you?"
Anthy,Of course. 
Anthy,The one I'm engaged to can do as he pleases with me.
Touga,Only the one who is engaged to her can do as he pleases with her.
Touga,"If something is really important to you, seize it and protect it with your own hands,"
Touga,"lest someone should steal it, Micky. "
Touga,There's no end to Duelists after the Rose Bride.
Miki,Don't worry. 
Miki,I'll protect that quality of your playing. 
Anthy,"Thank you, thank you. "
Wakaba,When is your make-up exam? 
Utena,Next week. 
Utena,"I guess... everything is gonna be OK, thanks to a great tutor."
Wakaba,Eh? Who is your tutor? 
Girl1,"It's Micky, it's Micky! "
Girl1,I wonder what he's doing here. 
Girl1,He's stopped. 
Utena,"Hi! If you're looking for Himemiya, she's probably in the greenhouse."
Miki,"Actually, I've business with you today, Tenjou-sempai."
Utena,"I'm doing okay. Linear functions, simultaneous equations, and stuff."
Wakaba,"So, your tutor is... "
Utena,Yep. 
Miki,"Today after school, I'll be waiting for you at the arena."
Miki,I'll be waiting for you. 
Boss,Behold this vast expanse of ocean! 
Boss,"Bringing a hundred men with me, I have set sail on the seven seas!"
Boss,I am a pirate. 
Boss,All the world's riches are now in my hands.
Henchman,"I wonder, I wonder, but Boss? "
Henchman,Why's your treasure chest missing ONLY what you want?
Boss,What I really want? 
Henchman,"Cos... That's why ya can't quit being a pirate boss, ain't it?"
boss,What I really want... 
Henchman,"Boss, what you really want... what you really want is..."
Boss,What I really want is.... 
Henchman,"Oops! Boss, we've sprung a leak. "

Miki,I have to get that music back. 
Miki,"Therefore, whatever it takes, I must have the Bride"
Utena,It suits you better to sit down at the piano.
Juri,Definitely. 
Anthy,O roses of the noble castle... 
Anthy,O Power of Dios that slumbers within me...
Anthy,Harken unto thy master and reveal to us...

Kozue,"Well, I never had the talent. "
Kozue,nor the interest...

Kozue,"When I was very young, "
Kozue,"there was a boy next door who often gave me love letters,"
Kozue,"saying ""I love your piano playing."" "
Kozue,He had the mistaken idea that I could play the piano well.
Kozue,"Since I'd always played with my brother, "
Kozue,people thought that I was as good as he was.
Kozue,"He was such a genius that no matter how badly I played, he could cover for it."
Kozue,"But when we had a concert, "
Kozue,he came down with a fever and it all fell apart.
Kozue,It came out that I couldn't do anything by myself.
girl,"Your brother is so cool, though. "
Kozue,He sure is.
