Girl,Are you okay? 
Girl,"Hey, there... "
Girl,Are you all right? 
Girl,What a weird girl. I shouldn't have bothered worrying.
Title,"Nanami-sama, Beware! "
Touga,Somebody's trying to kill you? 
Nanami,It isn't the first time either. 
Nanami,"A flowerpot almost fell on me, "
Nanami,"a pile of logs fell towards me, "
Nanami,and someone tried to push me down some stairs.
Miki,What awful luck... 
Nanami,"Help me, Onii-sama! "
Nanami,These attempts must certainly be the result of someone being jealous
Nanami,"of my cute looks, my popularity and refinement."
Nanami,I'm so scared! 
Touga,I was wondering what your story was going to be.
Touga,"Don't you think you read too many of those whodunnit novels, Nanami?"
Nanami,"Oh, no... "
Touga,"Sorry, but I'm busy with Student Council responsibilities. Excuse me."
Nanami,Onii-sama... 
Nanami,Rats. He was so cold. 
Miki,Sibling relationships are complex. 
Nanami,What does that mean? 
Miki,You don't have any idea? 
Miki,Did you do something that someone might hold a grudge against you for?
Nanami,How rude... 
Keiko,That's right. Nanami-sama knows what she's doing.
Aiko,She always gets others' hands dirty but never her own!
Miki,I see. 
Nanami,Don't listen to them! 
Miki,Sorry. 
Nanami,"You believe this isn't any of your concern,"
Nanami,but someone might be trying to take my life this very moment!
Aiko&Keiko,Nanami-sama! 
Utena,"Sorry, sorry! We didn't think it'd go this far."
Utena,Let's see... Where's the ball? Did you guys see the ball?
Nanami,"So, you're the one. "
Nanami,"You tried to drop a flowerpot on me, rolled a pile of logs toward me,"
Nanami,and pushed me down the stairs. That was all YOUR doing!
Utena,What're you talking about? 
Nanami,How frustrating! 
Nanami,Do you still insist on playing dumb? 
Yuuko,"Calm down, Nanami-sama. "
Aiko,We don't know for certain yet! 
Utena,"Yeah, whatever... just give me back the ball, okay?"
Utena,"Well, it couldn't possibly be me. In the first place, I don't have a motive for killing you."
Nanami,I can only wish. 
Nanami,"At the very least, I know you're trying to seduce my brother."
Utena,HE is making passes at me! 
Nanami,"My, what a self-conscious woman! "
Miki:,"Hey, there's someone in the greenhouse. "
Nanami,"But, there's a ""No Entry"" sign on the door."
Sign,"Sign: ""NO ENTRY"" "
Nanami,Onii-sama... 
Touga,Why haven't you finished her off yet? 
Touga,There's no reason to let that kind of creep live.
Anthy,But I can't do it. 
Touga,Do you have cold feet? We can't change the plans now.
Touga,Kill her once and for all. 
Miki,Did you hear that? 
Utena,"Yeah, he said ""kill her"" or something... "
Touga,"Do it. After you've made this one kill, we won't have any more problems."
Anthy,"That's not true. Even if everyone does hate her, a life is still a life."
Anthy,"If we just wait a while, maybe she'll just leave quietly."
Touga,Don't be too optimistic. 
Nanami,This can't be... My assassin is my own brother?
Nanami,"A secret talk? With all the trouble putting up that ""No Entry"" sign?"
Touga,"When this is finished, no one will stand in our way."
Anthy,"At last, we will be together. "
Touga,Here we go. 
Anthy,"Yes, Touga-sama. "
Touga,Nanami? 
Nanami,"How cruel of you, Onii-sama! "
Nanami,"I thought you've been a bit cold to me lately,"
Nanami,but do you feel that I am that much of a nuisance?
Touga,What are you talking about? 
Nanami,Idiot! 
Miki,Nanami-kun! 
Utena,"I've misjudged you. Even if you are the Student Council President, plotting to kill your own sister..."
Touga,What are you talking about? 
Utena,"You said ""kill her"" or something...? "
Anthy,Excuse me? 
text,"Can: ""Tick Killer"" "
Utena,That wouldn't be... 
Nanami,How cruel! It's too cruel! 
Nanami,The criminal who's trying to kill me turns out to be my beloved brother!
Nanami,I might as well be dead! 
BoyA,A runaway horse! 
BoyB,A horse is on the loose! 
BoyC,"Miss, are you hurt? Miss? "
Nanami,Wh- Who are you? 
Utena,What?! A prince appeared? 
Miki,Right. I heard she was rescued from a real dangerous situation by someone.
Utena,How cool! I'd die for that sort of thing.

Nanami,Tsuwabuki Mitsuru 
Miki,But that prince is a mystery. 
Utena,Mystery? 
BoyC,"Oh, no, you're bleeding. Permit me to take a look."
BoyC,All right. This should do it. 
Nanami,Thank you so much. 
Nanami,M- May I have your name at least? 
BoyC,I don't deserve the honor of telling you my name. I hope to see you again sometime.
BoyC,"Good bye, Miss. "
Utena,Leaving without even giving his name! How cool!

Miki,"Anyway, who would've thought there was a prince in this school who could find favor with Nanami-kun?"
Utena,Her ideals do seem to be very high. 
Utena,Is that her prince? 
Miki,So she does like older men... 
Utena,"No, wrong one. "
Miki,She has some taste! 
Utena,No way. 
Nanami,Tsuwabuki Mitsuru-kun? 
Tsuwabuki,Yes? 
Utena,Is that little boy the one she owes her life to?
Nanami,Here. Thank you. 
Nanami,"Please, Tsuwabuki-kun, be my boyfriend. "
Ako,It's a camp! 
Ako&Bko,It's a camp! It's a camp! How fun! 
Bko,The real pleasure of camp is making curry and rice in a messtin.
Ako&Bko,Let's eat! 
Ako,This rice is pretty hard in the center. 
Bko,And the bottom is scorched. 
Ako,"Besides, the curry is too runny without enough powder."
Ako,Do you really like it? 
Bko,"Oh, c'mon! This fresh air has a better taste than any food!"
Ako&Bko,Thanks for the food! 
Miki,It is rather good. 
Utena,I'm not talking about the meal! About Nanami!
Utena,Asking a grade schooler to be her boyfriend... 
Miki,She can't be serious. Her only favorite is Touga-sempai.
Utena,Mr. President? 
Miki,"Oops, that might have been considered tasteless..."
Utena,I didn't think so... 
Miki,I'm not talking about the meal. 
Utena,"Nanami and Mr. President are brother and sister, aren't they?"
Miki,"She's a brother's girl, after all. "
Miki,"Since the world's best man is always with her, Touga-sempai is the only man for her."
Miki,All other men are just as dirt. 
Utena,Dirt? 
Miki,Dirt. Crumbs. Parsley. 
Miki,It appears that this incident was a real shock to her.
Miki,She said she was betrayed by her only brother.
Utena,She's obsessive. 
Miki,"Tenjou-sempai, look. "
Utena,Th- they're dating. 
Miki,They look more like siblings than a couple.
Utena,Is she serious? 
Yuuko,I hear we'll be playing tennis in gym class today.
Nanami,"Oh, I didn't bring my tennis clothes! "
Nanami,Tsuwabuki. 
Tsuwabuki,"Here's some tennis wear, ma'am. "
Yuuko,Pop quizzes are so unfair. 
Nanami,Really... It's like they don't have any rules at all.
Nanami,Tsuwabuki. 
Tsuwabuki,"Here's a cribsheet, ma'am. "
Yuuko,I hear today's art class is about outdoor sketching.
Nanami,"Oh, I didn't bring my easel! "
Nanami,Tsuwabuki. 
Nanami,Will you put some meatballs in my lunch tomorrow?
Tsuwabuki,"Gladly, ma'am. "
Utena,Is that what she calls a boyfriend? 
Miki,I have no idea. 
Saionji,"However cruel, as long as he is with the only one he loves, he will be happy."
Saionji,"That's another form of love, as love can take many forms."
Saionji,And I'd say this love between Anthy and I is a secret love.
Saionji,A secret love... 
Utena,Nobody's listening to you. 
Aiko,"Hey, Suzuki-kun asked me to pass this to you."
Yuuko,"Hey, Yamada-kun wants you to read this. "
Keiko,"Hey, Tanaka-kun... "
Nanami,"Oh, throw those away, would you? "
Suzuki,I am Suzuki. 
Yamada,I am Yamada. 
Tanaka,I am Tanaka. 
Suzuki,"What's this supposed to mean, Nanami-kun? "
Yamada,You're dating that child after turning us down?
Tanaka,"Are you trying to make fools of us, the boys in Junior High?"
Nanami,You three... who are you? 
Suzuki,We write you love letters everyday. 
Yamada,Are you saying... 
Tanaka,...you forgot about us? 
Nanami,Tsuwabuki. 
Suzuki,There you are. 
Yamada,It's unforgivable for a child like you to date Nanami.
Tanaka,Why don't we settle this once and for all?
Tsuwabuki,"I've sworn that as long as I'm allowed to date her, I will protect her."
Nanami,"Tsuwabuki, take care of them. "
Tsuwabuki,"Gladly, ma'am. "
Nanami,"Come to think of it, the weather is nice today."
Nanami,So blue... The sky is so blue! 
Nanami,"Tsuwabuki, well done. "
Tsuwabuki,"I protected you, didn't I, Nanami-san? "
Utena,"I understand your true intentions, Nanami."
Nanami,Tenjou Utena. 
Utena,"Tsuwabuki-kun fought desperately to protect you,"
Utena,but you did nothing but watch. That isn't a true romance!
Utena,"You're just taking advantage of him, like he's a bodyguard."
Nanami,"I was almost killed by my own brother, the brother I had attached myself to."
Nanami,You couldn't understand how I feel! 
Miki,"Nanami-kun, you got it all wro... "
Nanami,I don't have it wrong! 
Nanami,"Since Tsuwabuki is my boyfriend, it should be my liberty to treat him as I like."
Miki,"I guess that would be called a minion, not a boyfriend."
Tsuwabuki,It's okay. This relationship is what I hoped for.
Utena,"Tsuwabuki-kun, why in the world are you so taken by her?"
Tsuwabuki,It was an encounter of fate. 
Utena,Fate...? 
Tsuwabuki,"Nanami-san doesn't seem to remember, but we have met a long time ago."
BoyA,A runaway bull! 
BoyB,A bull is on the loose! 
Tsuwabuki,Watch out! 
Touga,"Are you alright, Nanami? "
Nanami,Onii-sama... 
Touga,Let's go home. 
Tsuwabuki,C- Cool! 
Tsuwabuki,"Since that day, I've trained myself to become a heroic brother like that gentleman."
Tsuwabuki,And the stage was set. 
Utena,"You wanted to become her big brother, not her boyfriend?"
Tsuwabuki,"But Nanami-san doesn't remember me,"
Tsuwabuki,even though I staged the whole encounter so she would remember.
Miki,Staged? 
Tsuwabuki,"Now I have no other choice, but to endanger her again..."
Miki,W- Wait a minute. 
Tsuwabuki,Yes? 
Miki,"Surely, you're not the one who dropped that flowerpot,"
Miki,tried to crush her with logs and pushed her down the stairs?
Tsuwabuki,I am. 
Tsuwabuki,Rescuing her in the nick of time would make me the model brother.
Tsuwabuki,"Of course, I can't let Nanami-san find out about that..."
Nanami,"In short, he played his own work. "
Nanami,I overheard the whole story. 
Utena,Don't scold him! 
Utena,It was just a childish thing he did. 
Miki,Right. It was a youthful folly. He couldn't resist.
Nanami,I will not listen to excuses! 
Nanami,"Because of you, I called my brother an idiot!"
BoyA,A runaway kangaroo! 
BoyB,A kangaroo is on the loose! 
Nanami,Tsuwabuki! 
Utena,Tsuwabuki-kun! 
Tsuwabuki,I must protect... I must protect Nanami-san!
Utena,Take that! 
Miki,Tenjou-sempai! 
Tsuwabuki,Not them! 
Utena,Tsuwabuki-kun! 
Tsuwabuki,"Come on! Fight me, you bastard! "
Tsuwabuki,I will be Nanami-san's big brother. I will be Nanami-san's big brother!
Tsuwabuki,Nanami-san? 
Nanami,Silly! Run for it! 
Tsuwabuki,But... 
Nanami,"Onii-sama is Onii-sama, Tsuwabuki is Tsuwabuki..."
Nanami,"Even if you were killed, I wouldn't cry over you."
Nanami,"Why? Because, Tsuwabuki... "
Nanami,You are my valued servant. I can't lose you just because of this.
Nanami,Onii-sama! You came to help me! 
Touga,"This is a little too mischievous for you, Nanami."
Anthy,Utena! I've finished exterminating the bug in the rose garden!
Miki,"That ""No entry"" sign on the greenhouse and that worm he told her to kill, were all about a bug."
Nanami,Onii-sama... 
Nanami,Tsuwabuki... 
Tsuwabuki,Yes? 
Nanami,"Let's break up, the two of us... "
Tsuwabuki,All right. 
Tsuwabuki,Let's break up and I'll be adopted into your family.
Tsuwabuki,"If I can't become your big brother, I'll become your little brother."
Nanami,"Sure enough, you are the only man I would ever have, Onii-sama."
Utena,"Kiryuu Touga... he's no ordinary guy, that's for sure."
