juri,"See, I have no choice but to give up. "
juri,"After all, there are no such things in this world as miracles."
juri,Next! 
juri,Next! 
juri,Next! 
miki,It was amazing of you to beat that many people in a row.
miki,"No one's a match for you anymore, Juri-san. "
juri,So what would I possibly gain? 
juri,Would I break the world's shell? 
Title,Juri's Unfulfillment 
otoko,"Arisugawa-kun, "
otoko,I appreciate you Student Council members moderating last week's area study meeting.
otoko,"All the other teachers were impressed, saying it was better than recent years."
otoko,All of your Student Council activities will remain as our academy's tradition.
juri,"Thank you, sir. "
otoko,"Say, why don't we talk about the Student Council's future activities over lunch?"
juri,"Yes, sir. "
otoko,Wait here for a moment. 
onnna,You really don't follow the Academy Regulations. 
onnna,Where is it written in the regulations that you could bring pets to school?!
utena,"I didn't bring him, he just brought my lunch box for me."
utena,Is that against the regulations? 
onnna,Having a monkey bring what you've forgot... 
onnna,is too stupid a problem to be in the regulations!
onnna,"Do you understand, Tenjou Utena-san!? "
utena,When you put it that way... 
onnna,What's this rebellious attitude? 
onnna,Now I won't forgive y... 
onnna,Hey! Hold it! 
utena,"Oh, well... "
juri,Hi there. 
onnna,"I said, hold it! "
juri,Are you Tenjou Utena? 
utena,"You're a member of the Student Council, aren't you?"
onnna,Hold it! 
juri,I'd like to talk to you a little bit. 
onnna,"Utena-san, you help too! "
onnna,Hold it! 
utena,"Sorry, I can't spare the time just now... "
onnna,"All right, a dead end. Utena-san, shut the door."
utena,"Y- Yes, ma'am. "
otoko,Sorry to keep you waiting. Shall we go? 
juri,Vice-Principal... 
juri,That lady teacher you've been looking for
juri,just went in that consulting room over there.
otoko,Lady teacher? 
juri,"Oh, come on. You've just told me... "
juri,...that you have to talk with her about student guidance over lunch.
otoko,"Arisugawa-kun, what are you talking about? "
otoko,You and I are going for lunch... 
juri,I do not repeat myself. That is all. 
onnna,"Really? I'm so honored, asked by Vice-Principal. "
otoko,"Understood, so hurry up! "
onnna,"Oh, just a minute. I've got to fix my make-up."
otoko,I couldn't care less! Just hurry up! 
onnna,"Tenjou-san, I'll be right back, so stay here!"
juri,"Well, it looks like you have a little time now."
utena,"Whew, what a relief. That's what I'd call a miracle."
utena,"I've often heard rumors about you, even in junior high."
utena,"You're the captain of the Fencing Club, "
utena,and a brilliant Student Council member that even the teachers defer to...
utena,"But the truth is that you're extremely wicked,"
utena,and anyone who knows your true colors keeps at least ten meters away.
juri,As if I'm a wild animal... 
utena,"I don't know if this is true or not, "
utena,"but even teachers are kicked out of the academy, once they get on your blacklist."
juri,Heh... 
juri,Looks like one shouldn't underestimate the intelligence networks of the underclassmen.
Utena,"So, the rumors about you are true? "
juri,Who knows? 
juri,I've often heard rumors that you are quite skillful with the sword.
utena,"Oh no, not really. I don't really like swordfighting, myself."
utena,"Speaking of which, since you're a Student Council member,"
utena,"then you're after the Rose Bride, too, aren't you?"
juri,Do you know the reason why they're after the Rose Bride?
juri,It seems that whoever is engaged to the Rose Bride...
juri,"...will obtain the power of miracles, the power to revolutionize the world."
utena,That's pretty cool. 
utena,"Then, since I'm engaged to her right now, the miracle power belongs to me."
utena,That'll be convenient for finals. 
utena,I could ace all my tests without even studying!
utena,Are you all really serious about... 
utena,...doing stupid things like fighting Duels over Himemiya?
juri,You're right. Fighting over the Rose Bride is stupid.
shiori,"Believe in a miracle, that your wish come true."
juri,"No, there can be no miracles. "
utena,We seem to be on the same wavelength. 
anaunnsu,"Tenjou Utena-san, report immediately to the student consulting room. Repeat..."
utena,Good grief... that teacher won't give up.
utena,"Anyway, I'm glad there's someone in the Student Council who understands me ."
annshi-,Uhm... Would you mind if I gave you this?
juri,Don't be conceited.

miki,What? Including Juri-san? 
touga,Of course. She also has a seat here to fight Duels.
miki,"Well, sure she's eligible, and skilled, too."
miki,"But she doesn't have a motive for fighting, does she?"
touga,Sure she does. 
touga,"She wants to disprove the power of the Rose Bride, the power of miracles."
miki,What? Is that true? 
juri,Who knows? But at the least I've got to study for finals on my own.
miki,Huh? What's that mean? 
touga,But are you sure you want to disprove the miracle power?
touga,If the power to revolutionize the world 
touga,is the one that will fulfill your unrequited feeling...
touga,if you don't have to give up on your romance yet...
touga,then do you still want to disprove the power of the Rose Bride?
miki,"Are you in love with someone, Juri-san? "
miki,An unrequited feeling is hard to bear. 
juri,"Yes, I was in love. "
shounenn,You've got me. 
shounenn,I give up. I'm beaten completely. 
shounenn,"You'd be a good match for even high school guys, Juri."
juri,Thank you. 
shiori,"Believe in a miracle, that your wish come true."
juri,But I knew... that this romance would never be fulfilled.
juri,"""Believe in a miracle, that your wish come true."""
juri,That was her favorite phrase. 
shiori,"He doesn't say it, but he seems to be thinking of you the most, Juri-san."
shiori,But I couldn't help but steal him from you.
shiori,"Even though I'm no match for you at anything,"
shiori,at least my feeling for him is... 
shiori,Did you know? 
shiori,Juri-san is in love with someone. 
shiori,But... 
shiori,...it isn't you. 
shiori,"So, I don't regret stealing him from you..."
shiori,...because that's what I hoped for from my heart.
shiori,"Believe in a miracle, that your wish come true."
shiori,You must hate me for being like this. 
juri,Thank you for your letter. I'm more than happy to know you're doing fine.
juri,"As I read each word of your letter, "
juri,I can't help but realize how the days have passed.
juri,"Back then, the three of us did everything together."
juri,It was really fun. 
juri,"But now, when I look at the two of you, beaming with happiness,"
juri,I feel nostalgic and envious... 
utena,"There, there... "
utena,"What a pain, crying at this hour... "
utena,"Oh, there, there... "
utena,"Chuchu, please, go to sleep already. I'm really sleepy myself."
utena,Huh? Arisugawa-sempai? 
utena,I thought so. 
juri,"Oh, it's you. "
utena,"Since you're not wearing your usual uniform, I almost didn't recognize you."
juri,Really? 
utena,You really look like a supermodel. 
utena,"You look gallant in your uniform, "
utena,but everyone would be surprised if they saw you this ladylike.
utena,"So, why are you here by yourself this late?"
juri,"You even wear that at night, huh? "
utena,Yeah... 
juri,Why are you always dressed like a boy? 
utena,"Well, how should I put it... "
utena,"To tell the truth, I'm influenced by my prince."
juri,Prince? 
utena,"When I was a little kid, I met a prince. "
utena,"And he said ""I want that you should never lose your strength and nobility."""
utena,"And then, as a reminder of our encounter, he gave me this."
utena,"""It will lead you to where I'll be,"" he said."
utena,He looked so cool to me. 
utena,I want to see him again. 
utena,"I mean, I want to become as close to him as I can."
utena,"And so, I wear this. "
utena,"Oh, sorry for telling you strange stories like this..."
utena,"However, I don't believe the Student Council"
utena,"about the Rose Bride or the power of miracles, but..."
utena,How should I put it... I can believe in the fate between him and me.
utena,"If you call it a miracle, maybe it is one, but..."
utena,Sempai...? 
juri,"Your Rose Signet, throw this ring away! "
juri,It's disgusting! Your so-called nobility is to copycat as someone you love told you!
juri,"Yes, fighting over the Rose Bride "
juri,is just as stupid as your sentiment to your prince!
juri,"However, to be qualified for that, you must be truly noble!"
juri,The Rose Signet doesn't suit a girl the likes of you!
utena,No! 
utena,"This is my one and only tie with him. I won't lose it, no matter what!"
juri,"Then show me what you call a ""miracle!"" My sword will show its true nature!"
