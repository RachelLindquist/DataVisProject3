voice,Once upon a time... 
voice,...there was a princess grieving over the deaths of her mother and father.
voice,Before this princess there appeared a prince traveling upon a white horse.
voice,"His appearance gallant, and his smile gentle, the prince enveloped the princess"
voice,"in the scent of roses, and wiped away her tears."
voice,"""Little one bearing up alone under grief, "
voice,"please lose not thy strength and nobility when thou growest up."""
voice,"""As a token of this day, please retain this."""
voice,"""Pray, shall we meet once more?"" "
voice,"""This ring should guide thee to me."" "
voice,Was the ring from the prince meant as an engagement ring?
voice,"That part was good, "
voice,"but because of the strength of her admiration for the prince,"
voice,the princess made up her mind to become a prince herself!
voice,But is that really good for her? 
Title,The Great Curry High-Trip 
Keiko,"Nanami-sama, "
Keiko,"8th Grade, Class A, has started cooking practice, as scheduled."
Nanami,So it appears. 
Nanami,And what we were discussing earlier...? 
Keiko,"Yes, ma'am, I just made the substitution. "
Keiko,"100X curry, an Indian specialty hot enough to make you breathe fire."
Nanami,Excellent. 
Nanami,"Watch out, Tenjou Utena and Himemiya Anthy."
Nanami,I'll soon have you begging for mercy. 
Nanami,This will be your punishment for trying to tempt my brother!
Keiko,Nanami-sama! 
Nanami,"Be quiet, it's getting good now. "
Keiko,"I'm sorry, but, um.. "
Nanami,What? 
Aiko,The substitution wasn't for 100X curry... 
Keiko,"It appears to be for super spicy 900 Billion X curry,"
Keiko,so hot it will blast you to smithereens and make phantom elephants trumpet loudly.
Nanami,Phantom... smithereens? 
Nanami,No way... 
Touga,"If the egg's shell does not break, the chick will die without being born."
Touga,We are the chick; the egg is the world. 
Touga,"If the world's shell does not break, we will die without being born."
Touga,Break the world's shell. 
Touga&Juri,For the sake of revolutionizing the world!
Touga,"Councilors, this is the greatest disaster for the Rose Signet Code."
Touga,The Rose Bride and the one she is engaged to have fallen.
Touga,"This was an unforseen turn of events, even for the Ends of the World."
Touga,I have a report that at this rate their lives are in danger.
Miki,It's my fault. 
Touga,Miki. 
Miki,I kept telling Himemiya-san how I wanted to eat extremely hot curry.
Miki,"Risking her life for me, Himemiya-san made curry..."
Touga,"Well, that doesn't mean it's your fault, Miki."
Juri,"But, what do we do now? "
Juri,The truth is that just one batch of curry ruined our plot.
Miki,It's all my fault. 
Touga,It's me. What? 
Touga,They were released? Both of them? 
Wakaba,"Utena, Utena! Utena-sama! "
Wakaba,"Boy, you had me worried! "
Wakaba,Are you all right? 
Wakaba,"I heard there was a huge explosion, and I was worried to death, and... Huh?"
Wakaba,I'm sorry! 
Wakaba,"I wasn't thinking, hugging you like always."
Wakaba,"I should call an ambulance, yeah, ah, um, ah..."
Anthy,There's no need to call an ambulance. 
Anthy,I'm fine. Sorry to have worried you. 
Wakaba,"There's something strange about you, Utena."
Keiko,You're in an awfully good mood lately. 
Aiko,But don't get all proud with that tomboy around you all the time.
Yuuko,"Some nights it gets really dark, you know?"
Keiko,"Hey, don't just stand there, say something. "
Miki,What are you doing? 
Nanami,"Oh, Micky! Don't sneak up on me like that."
Miki,Himemiya-san! 
Keiko,You... you slapped me! 
Keiko,Not even my own mother has ever slapped me!
Utena,"If you keep up these petty false accusations, "
Utena,I'll really become your enemy. 
Miki,It... it can't be... 
Miki,"The pure, innocent Himemiya-san has... "
Nanami,Switched personalities? 
Keiko,These are the hidden photos of them over the past days.
Aiko,"Himemiya Anthy, Tenjou Utena... their behaviour patterns are completely switched."
Nanami,"It's true, but how? "
Keiko,Everything dates back to that curry explosion. 
Nanami,"Utena is Anthy, and Anthy is Utena? "
Nanami,All because of that 900 Billion X spice... 
Nanami,That's crazy... 
girl,"Five, please. "
Aiko,That'll be 2000 yen. 
girl,Gallant Anthy is cooler than I expected. 
girl,"Calm Utena is attractive, too. "
Nanami,You're selling them...? 
Aiko,"Their charm is unexpected, isn't it? "
Keiko,They're popular with both boys and girls. 
Miki,My goodness! 
Miki,"This, this can't be Himemiya-san! "
Miki,"But, now that I've bought them, I can't stand myself."
Yuuko,"Okay, you wanted 20, right? "
Keiko&Aiko,Thank you. 
Nanami,"Really, I don't see what's so great about her."
Touga,"I see, so that's how it is. "
Nanami,Onii-sama! 
Touga,"I thought it seemed suspicious, "
Touga,but I didn't think that you actually were involved in all this.
Nanami,"N- no, I, um, ah, well, that is... "
Aiko,Here are the negatives. 
Keiko,Thank you. 
Nanami,"Et tu, Onii-sama? "
Utena,"I see, so that's how it was. "
Utena,So you all were behind this. 
Touga,I'm afraid there's been a misunderstanding. 
Nanami,"That's right, a misunderstanding. "
Nanami,My brother would never make passes at you two.
Nanami,This was all MY doing. 
Touga,Nanami! 
Touga,You've gotten me into a very troubling situation.
Nanami,"Please forgive me, Onii-sama. "
Nanami,"When they were going to make delicious curry during Anthy-san's cooking practice,"
Nanami,Nanami got this phantom Indian spice especially for them.
Nanami,But I can't believe it caused all of this.
Utena,You're the one I can't believe. 
Nanami,"If we could just get the phantom spice once more,"
Nanami,I'm sure Utena-san and Anthy-san would be able to return to their old selves.
Nanami,"So, please, Onii-sama! "
Touga,Okay. You may not return until you once more have the phantom spice.
Nanami,"I understand. Thank you, Onii-sama. "
Keiko,"She said it but, I wonder where is the phantom spice?"
Yuuko,"Well, it came from India, didn't it? "
Keiko&Aiko,India?! 
Nanami,"Wait for me, Onii-sama! I shall return! "
Keiko&Aiko,"You mean we're supposed to go with her, too?"
Ako,A lesson on the idioms of love and youth. 
Ako,"Today's phrase is ""You reap what you sow."" "
Bko,"""You reap what you sow."" "
Ako,"It means that if you do bad things, then misfortune will befall you."
Bko,Give me your money! 
Bko,What the hell? 
Ako,"If you're going to do bad things, you must be prepared for that."
Anthy,"Utena-sama, that's wonderful. "
Utena,"Well, it feels weird being praised by my own body."
Anthy,"You see, I'm not very good at sports, "
Anthy,so seeing my own body acting so wonderfully makes me happy.
Utena,"But, we gotta think of a way to return to normal."
Anthy,Don't worry. 
Anthy,I'm sure even now Nanami-san is...
Utena,"Anyway, it'll be bad if we don't find a way to return to our old bodies soon."
Utena,I don't want to be the victim of the Rose Signet.
Anthy,"I don't mind being like this, because I don't judge by outside appearances."
Utena,"Well, I do mind. Saionji has been coming on to me."
Saionji,"I've been waiting, Himemiya Anthy. "
Utena,"See, here he comes. "
Saionji,It's that time again. Follow me. 
Anthy,Could I go with you? 
Saionji,"You can stay here. Come on, Anthy. "
Nanami,You really helped me. When that elephant was chasing me I thought it was all over.
Nanami,"By the way, have you heard of the Phantom 900 Billion X spice?"
man,Phantom? 
Saionji,I have longed for this day. 
Utena,"Oh, Himemiya, what are you usually doing with Saionji in a place like this?"
Saionji,"Anthy, I'll get right to the point: I need you to keep your promise."
Utena,"Uh, what was that again? "
Saionji,"As always, you're good at teasing me. "
Saionji,"Well, if that's how you're going to be then I'll say it."
Saionji,Today is one of the two days that we prove our love each week.
Utena,Prove our love?! 
Saionji,The same as always. 
Utena,"W, wait a minute. "
Saionji,"Even if we defy fate itself, our bond is genuine."
Saionji,Even though we must keep it a secret for now.
Saionji,"Don't turn your eyes away. Look at me, the real me."
Utena,No! No! 
Saionji,Here you will see nothing but the truth... in our exchange diary.
Utena,Huh? Diary? 
Nanami,Phantom spice... 
Nanami,Phantom spice... 
Keiko,Nanami-sama! 
Nanami,An elephant? 
Saionji,"Now I am content with just this diary for the moment,"
Saionji,"but someday, when I master the sword, I'll show everyone I can get you back."
Saionji,"Wait for that day, Anthy. "
Utena,That Saionji. He's serious. 
Utena,"I'm sure that since she knew his feelings, "
Utena,she just continued the diary for him and kept it a secret even from me.
Utena,"But, what can I do? "
Utena,"The best way would be to ask her to write a response to him,"
Utena,but if I do that Saionji and Himemiya will know that I know their secret.
Utena,"And, of course, I can't write it myself. "
Anthy,"Ah, Saionji-sempai's exchange diary. "
Anthy,"Well, Utena-sama, please return it to Sempai."
Utena,"Huh? You mean, are you telling me to write it?"
Anthy,Because now Utena-sama is Himemiya Anthy. 
Utena,I can't spy on your privacy. That's just wrong.
Anthy,Wrong? 
Utena,"Yeah, it's wrong. "
Anthy,"Well, then, I'll quit. "
Utena,"Wait a minute, what are you doing? That's a bit extreme."
Utena,You can't just throw it away! 
Anthy,"I was only continuing the diary because you never said to stop, Utena-sama."
Anthy,"Now that you've said it was wrong, Utena-sama, "
Anthy,I can't continue with Saionji- sempai's exchange diary.
Utena,What I want to say is... 
Anthy,Yes? 
Utena,"Well, Saionji has gotten to be really pathetic."
Anthy,Ah! 
Keiko,Nanami-sama! 
Nanami,Not again! 
Utena,"Ah, the only thing to do is write it. Let's see..."
Utena,"Dear Anthy, even now I'm dreaming of the time you and I were engaged."
Utena,"Hey, look, he's really serious, isn't he?"
Saionji,"To my beloved Anthy, "
Saionji,I'm sorry for making you wait all the time.
Saionji,"I'm satisfied with the diary for now, "
Saionji,"but surely I'll overthrow that impudent, ugly tomboy Tenjou..."
Saionji,and surely I'll show them I can get you back.
Saionji,"By, Saionji Kyouichi. "
Utena,This ain't funny at all. 
Nanami,Where's the spice? The phantom spice? 
Keiko,Nanami-sama! 
Saionji,"Anthy, it's almost here, the day I return to a rose colored life with you."
Touga,"This is unusual, Saionji. You, showing your face at the rose garden..."
Saionji,"Listen well, Touga. The Rose Bride will soon return to me."
Touga,"Oh, Anthy? "
Saionji,No one can tear apart our love... surely not even the Rose Signet Code.
Touga,"Oh, Anthy? "
Utena,Saionji-sempai! 
Saionji,"Oh, Anthy, I've been waiting for you. "
Utena,"Forgive me, but I couldn't stop laying bare all my thoughts."
Utena,"Please, take it. "
Saionji,"So, you think that much of me. I'll take only your true intentions. Well..."
Miki,"Sempai, I just now heard that Nanami-san has returned."
Touga,What? 
Diary,Casanova 
Nanami,Onii-sama! 
Touga,"Nanami, you've become strong. "
Nanami,I found it! This is the phantom spice! 
Touga,"Well done, Nanami! "
Utena,"All right, with this we can return to our old selves!"
Nanami,Onii-sama! 
Touga,Nanami! 
Touga,"Nanami, the replacement? "
Nanami,That was the last one. 
Nanami,They said it will take another 200 years to refine it to 900 Billion X spice.
Utena,200 years? 
Ako,"Could this be a case of ""Reaping what you sow?"""
Bko,Could it be? 
Nanami,"The spice, the rare phantom spice I took all that trouble to obtain..."
Utena,We'll be like this forever? 
Anthy,"Now, now, everyone please don't get depressed. "
Anthy,Please have some of my special curry and try to cheer up.
Utena,I don't really feel like eating curry but...
Keiko,Nanami-sama... 
Nanami,What is it? Silence! 
Keiko,"I'm sorry but, look at this. "
Miki,Th- That's... 
Nanami,The phantom 900 Billion X spice. 
Utena,What? 
Aiko,It was left in the cooking room. 
Aiko,Unopened... 
Keiko,It looks like it was never used in that curry.
Utena,So that means that explosion... 
Nanami,wasn't caused by the spice... 
Utena&Nana,It was from Anthy's cooking skills? 
Miki,"That's incredible, Himemiya-san! "
Miki,"This is a new invention, curry that explodes and causes a personality switch when eaten."
Anthy,"Oh, you're embarrassing me. "
Utena,Saionji... 
Saionji,"Anthy, what is this? "
Saionji,Since when would you so calmly write such shameless things?
Saionji,"That's it, it's because you've been living with that vulgar Tenjou Utena."
Saionji,"Now I see, Anthy. "
Saionji,"I'll pretend I never read that, so please re- write it. Fill a new page with words of love."
Anthy,"Well, how is the curry? "
Anthy,"It's a new invention, you know. "
Saionji,"Yes, it's just right this time. "
Utena,"That, that curry is... "
Anthy,My new invention. 
Wakaba,"So, when you came to after the explosion's shock you were both your old selves again?"
Utena,You got it. 
Wakaba,"Huh, unbelievable. "
Utena,I had a really hard time. No more curry for me.
Anthy,Yes. 
Utena,By the way... 
Anthy,Yes? 
Utena,What's with him? 
ED,Missing truth and forever 
ED,Kissing love and true your heart 
ED,Embrace me with your true arms 
ED,The key to open up tomorrow is reality 
ED,I want to keep on destroying lies. 
ED,"Even if we keep on talking, "
ED,you still won't ever see. 
ED,Excuses really suit adults 
ED,who hang on to old stories. 
ED,Because unchosen angels 
ED,have no need for wings. 
ED,"Missing truth and forever, "
ED,"Kissing love and true your heart, "
ED,I will like tomorrow's new me. 
ED,"At least I believe so; I want to believe it,"
ED,so I want to keep lies hating me.
