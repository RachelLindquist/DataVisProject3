girl,I hear there's going to be a duel in the kendo dojo!
girl,Touga-sempai and Saionji-sempai again? 
Utena,A duel? 
girl,"Yeah, go for it! "
girl,Dreamy! 
girl,"Oh, Touga-sama, look over here! "
girl,Dreamy! Cool! 
girl,"Get him, Saionji-sempai! "
girl,Sempai! 
girl,Hooray! Hooray! Touga-sama! 
girl,"Get him! Get him, Saionji! "
boy,"Shh, they're starting. "
Utena,Heh... he's pretty good. 
Utena,"Guess he's not just some Casanova, after all."
Utena,Looks like Mr. President won this one. 
girl,Saionji-sempai! 
girl,Touga-sempai is the greatest! 
Girls,"Oh, you are my prince! "
Utena,Prince? 
girl,He's so cool! 
Touga,"Hey, now... "
Touga,Don't look at me so grimly... my dear friend.
Saionji,Who's your dear friend? 
Touga,How heartless... 
Touga,Aren't you my one and only friend? 
Saionji,Enough! 
Saionji,I'll NOT be defeated by the likes of you!
Title,The Castle Said To Hold Eternity 
Saionji,"What a pain in the ass you are, hanging around Anthy all the time!"
Utena,Look who's talking! 
Utena,"Stubborn people are the most hated, Sempai."
Saionji,"So it's you, Tenjou Utena. "
Saionji,Don't get carried away. 
Saionji,I will defeat you in the next duel and take Anthy back.
Saionji,Shut up! 
Utena,"You, beat me? "
Utena,You just got beaten by Kiryuu Touga a little while ago.
Saionji,You were watching? 
Saionji,I've fought hundreds of duels with him over the past 10 years.
Saionji,Today was just luck. 
Utena,Wow... you've known each other that long?
Saionji,I will not lose to him. 
Saionji,And I will take possession of the Rose Bride.
Utena,Do you really love Himemiya? 
Utena,"If you do, why are you trying to win her by dueling?"
Saionji,Only by winning her in a duel can I defeat him.
Utena,"By him, you mean Touga? "
Utena,Is this just some rivalry with Touga? 
Utena,Are you just using Himemiya to get at him?
Saionji,You wouldn't understand even if I told you.
Saionji,"With Anthy by my side, I will gain something eternal."
Utena,Eternal? 
Saionji,That's right. 
Saionji,"She told me that she, too, wants to obtain eternity."
Saionji,I told you it was gonna rain. 
Saionji,That's why I told you to stop at the 10th match.
Touga,"Oh, well. There isn't anyone good enough to practice with besides you."
Saionji,Well... I guess... 
Saionji,"What is it, Touga? "
Touga,It's a funeral. 
Saionji,I wonder who died... 
Man1,"Hey, you there! "
Man1,"You two haven't seen a girl about your age around here, have you?"
Touga,What happened? 
Man1,There was a girl who lost her parents in an accident today.
Man1,She disappeared when we weren't looking. 
Touga,"Well, we haven't seen her. "
Man1,"I see... OK, thanks. "
Man2,"She couldn't have been spirited away, could she?"
Man1,That's a pretty stupid thing to say. 
Man1,Let's look around here a little longer. 
Saionji,Talking about being 'spirited away' in this day and age...
Saionji,Touga... 
Saionji,Hey! 
Saionji,Are we allowed to go in here? 
Saionji,"Hey, wait! "
Touga,"It was three coffins, all right. "
Touga,I could see them through a crack in the doors back then.
Saionji,What? 
Saionji,What are you doing? 
Saionji,Touga! 
Saionji,"Hey, stop it. Don't do that. Stop it."
Saionji,STOP IT!!! 
Utena,Don't open it. 
Utena,"Please, don't open it. "
Saionji,She's been hiding in a place like this?
Touga,Everyone's been looking for you. 
girl,Are you going to tell someone I'm in here?
Touga,"No, I won't tell anyone. "
Saionji,Hey... 
Touga,I'm always on the girl's side... 
Touga,...because I am a gentleman. 
Saionji,"Still, why have you been hiding in a place like this?"
girl,Because this is where I belong. 
Saionji,What do you mean? 
girl,"There are coffins lined up next to mine, right?"
girl,My father and mother died today. 
girl,And there was one coffin left over. 
girl,It must have been meant for me. 
girl,Being alive is kind of sickening. 
Touga,I see... 
girl,It's sickening... 
girl,Why does everyone go on living knowing they'll end up dying anyway?
girl,I wonder why I never realized that until today.
girl,"Eternity couldn't possibly exist, could it?"
Saionji,Eternity? 
girl,"And so, it's all right now. "
girl,I will never leave this coffin. 
Saionji,"But someone will find you, eventually. "
girl,Then I'll just go hide in another coffin. 
girl,"I'll never see anyone, or come out into the sun again."
Saionji,Wait! Don't you think she might do something stupid if we leave her like that?
Touga,"Then, why don't you show her something eternal?"
Saionji,"The next day, she'd come out of the coffin."
Saionji,And there was something about the look in her eyes...
Saionji,Did you do something to her after what happened yesterday?
Touga,"No, nothing. "
Saionji,"However, I thought for sure that he must've shown her something eternal."
Saionji,Kiryuu Touga... 
Saionji,"He's always ahead of me, going to a world I don't know."
Anthy,"Someday, I want to go to that castle hanging in the sky."
Anthy,There is something eternal up there. 
Saionji,"You've seen that castle hanging in the sky, too, haven't you?"
Saionji,In that castle is eternity. 
Saionji,I'm going there with her. 
Saionji,I won't lose to Touga! 
Juri,"By the way, Tenjou Utena said she had met a prince when she was very young."
Micky,A prince? 
Juri,Yes. 
Juri,She said she came to the academy to see a prince she met when she was very young.
Touga,She's quite the romantic. 
Touga,"A prince, eh? "
Touga,I see. 
Narration,"""That ring will guide you to me."" "
Narration,It was undoubtedly the princess's first love.
Narration,"And so, was the ring from the prince meant as an engagement ring?"
Utena,"I'll see you again, won't I? "
Utena,Hey! That's cold! What the heck are you doing!?
Touga,You looked awfully lonesome from back here.
Utena,It's none of your business. 
Touga,"What are you doing up here, hmm? "
Utena,Do you know something... about that castle?
Touga,Castle? 
Utena,That castle hanging in the sky that you can see from the duel arena...
Utena,...I wonder what it really is. 
Touga,That castle is the place where you and your prince are supposed to meet someday.
Utena,"Somebody told you something they shouldn't have, huh?"
Touga,Wasn't your prince a guy like me? 
Utena,Stop it! 
Utena,Quit jerking me around. 
Utena,This ain't no joke. 
Saionji,From the Ends of the World? 
A-Ko,Oh! A UFO! 
B-Ko,"Where, where, where, where... where? "
B-Ko,"Oh, for crying out loud... it's just a shooting star."
A-Ko,"No, no, NO! It's a UFO! "
A-Ko,"It flew across the sky all jittery, uh, I mean, zigzaggy."
B-Ko,"In that case, it's a shooting star flying zigzaggy."
B-Ko,There's no way UFOs could exist! 
A-Ko,It was when I was in kindergarten... 
B-Ko,What was? 
A-Ko,...that they said Santa Claus didn't exist.
B-Ko,Oh gawd... 
A-Ko,It's OK though. I understand. 
B-Ko,Understand what? 
A-Ko,"Wizards, "
A-Ko,"fairies, "
A-Ko,"princes on white horses, "
A-Ko,and kind-hearted friends... 
A-Ko,...are only found in fantasy. 
Both,"It's okay, though. I understand. "
A-Ko,"And so, at least I still have UFOs... "
B-Ko,"That's kinda tricky, ain't it? "
A-Ko,"Oops, they're broken. "
Utena,"Hey, Himemiya. "
Utena,It's supper time. 
Utena,"Chuchu, where's your owner? "
Utena,She hasn't come back yet? That's unusual. 
Utena,Could that be her? 
Utena,"Okay, okay. "
Utena,"Hello, East Hall, 2nd floor... "
Phone,Himemiya Anthy will be spirited away tonight.
Utena,What? 
Phone,Go to the duel arena. 
Utena,Who are you? 
Utena,Hey! 
Anthy,"Please stop, Saionji-sempai. "
Anthy,You're hurting me. 
Anthy,"I have to go home now, or Utena-sama will be worried."
Saionji,And what of Utena-sama? 
Saionji,I'm the one keeping the promise with you.
Anthy,Promise? 
Saionji,"Correct. Tonight, we'll finally be able to go to the castle said to hold eternity."
Anthy,"No, you mustn't. "
Anthy,It's not allowed for anyone not engaged to me to take me to the duel arena without the arrangement ofa duel.
Saionji,The Ends of the World told me that the castle would fall tonight.
Saionji,I won't let anybody else have you. 
Saionji,The one to obtain eternity with you... 
Saionji,...WILL BE ME! 
Utena,"Sheesh, what the... "
Utena,Sa... Saionji? 
Utena,"Saionji, wake up! "
Saionji,Tenjou... 
Utena,Where's Himemiya? 
Saionji,Anthy... 
Utena,What are you up to? 
Utena,"I thought you couldn't take her back without beating me in a duel, right?"
Saionji,What the hell are you doing here? 
Utena,I was told to come here because Himemiya would be spirited away.
Saionji,Spirited away? 
Saionji,Spirited away... 
Saionji,Spirited away... 
Saionji,Anthy... 
Saionji,Where's Anthy? 
Utena,That's what I'm asking you. 
Saionji,Hey! 
Saionji,Did you open it? 
Utena,"No, not me. "
Saionji,Impossible... 
Utena,"Hey, wait! "
Utena,What the... 
Saionji,This... 
voice,Please don't open it. 
voice,"Eternity couldn't possibly exist, could it?"
Utena,Himemiya... 
Saionji,Anthy! 
Saionji,What? 
Utena,What the... 
Utena,Himemiya! 
Saionji,Tenjou! 
Utena,What's going on here? 
Utena,"Anyway, I've gotta save Himemiya! "
Saionji,The castle... the castle's falling down.
Saionji,"Here I am, Ends of the World! "
Saionji,Now fulfill your promise and deliver eternity unto me!
Utena,HIMEMIYA!!!!! 
Saionji,What's this? What's going on here? 
Saionji,What the hell was that? 
Utena,Himemiya... Himemiya... 
Utena,"Himemiya! Hey, snap out of it, Himemiya! "
Saionji,No... I was to be the one to rescue her from the coffin this time.
Saionji,No! I am the one who will save her this time. The castle said to contain eternity...
Saionji,the power to revolutionize the world... 
Saionji,...will all be mine. 
Saionji,The one who will accompany Anthy to that castle will be me!
Utena,Himemiya... 
Utena,Himemiya! Himemiya! 
Anthy,Utena-sama... 
Utena,I'm so glad... 
Utena,"But, what on earth happened? "
Anthy,"Actually, I'm not quite sure... "
Anthy,Utena-sama! 
Utena,Touga! Why? 
Touga,Wasn't your prince... 
Touga,...someone like me? 
Saionji,Why do you always... 
Touga,"I'm a gentleman, that's why. "
Touga,It's me. 
Touga,"Yes, the letter sent to Saionji tonight was from me."
Touga,"Right, in your name. "
Touga,"No, it's just a flesh wound. "
Touga,"Well, just a few dramatics. "
Touga,"Yes, Saionji will be punished by expulsion. "
Touga,Nonsense. 
Touga,Anyone who truly believes he has friends is a fool.
