Narration,Once upon a time... ,1,1
Narration,...there was a princess grieving over the deaths of her mother and father.,1,1

Narration,"His appearance gallant, and his smile gentle, the prince enveloped the princess",1,1

Narration,"""This ring should guide thee to me."" ",1,1
Narration,Was the ring from the prince meant as an engagement ring?,1,1
Narration,"That part was good, ",1,1
Narration,"but because of the strength of her admiration for the prince,",1,1
Narration,the princess made up her mind to become a prince herself!,1,1
Narration,But is that really good for her? ,1,1

Woman,Tenjou Utena-san. ,1,1
Woman,Do you plan to keep on wearing those strange clothes this semester?,1,1
Utena,Strange? ,1,1
Woman,Strange. ,1,1
Utena,All the boys are dressed like I am. ,1,1
Woman,You are a girl! ,1,1
Woman,So why do you keep on wearing a boy's uniform?,1,1
Utena,There's no rule here that says a girl can't wear a boy's uniform.,1,1
Utena,No problem then! ,1,1
Utena,"So, in that case... ",1,1
Woman,"You little... You're going to keep evading me this semester, too, aren't you...",1,1
Crowd,"Go, Utena-sama!! ",1,1
Boy,"Sheesh, skunked again... ",1,1
Girl,"Oh, Utena-sama, use my towel, too! ",1,1
Utena,"Sure, sure, wait your turn. ",1,1
Boy,"Say, Tenjou, if you'd just join our basketball team,",1,1
Boy,the local playoffs would be a sure thing! ,1,1
Utena,"Now look! I'm a girl, you know. ",1,1
Utena,"I don't like playing basketball with a bunch of stinking, sweaty boys.",1,1
Boy,"Why not? You're mighty boyish yourself, Tenjou.",1,1
Utena,Don't say such rude things. ,1,1
Boy,"Well then, why do you wear that boy's uniform? ",1,1
Utena,"That's ""prince."" ",1,1
Boy,Huh? ,1,1
Utena,"Instead of a princess to be protected, ",1,1
Utena,I want to become a dashing prince. ,1,1
Boy,What's that mean? ,1,1
Utena,That smell... ,1,1
Utena,It's the smell of roses. ,1,1
Utena,How long have I felt nostalgic over the scent of roses?,1,1
Utena,What's going on over there? ,1,1
Utena,A lovers' quarrel? ,1,1
Utena,At least do that someplace where no one else can see you.,1,1
Utena,"Hey, hey... that's going a bit too far. ",1,1
Utena,Whew... ,1,1
Wakaba,Utena! ,1,1
Utena,Wakaba.. you're heavy... ,1,1

Utena,Saionji? ,1,1
Wakaba,You don't know who Saionji-sama is? ,1,1
Utena,"Oh, is he famous? ",1,1
Utena,I know who the guy in front of him is. ,1,1
Utena,"That's got to be Kiryuu Touga, the Student Council President, right?",1,1
Wakaba,"Yep! And the other guy is the Vice-President, Saionji Kyouichi-sama.",1,1
Utena,What about her? ,1,1
Wakaba,Ahh... that's Himemiya Anthy. ,1,1
Utena,Himemiya... Anthy... ,1,1
Wakaba,"All she does is take care of the roses, though no one's asked her to. She's so weird.",1,1
Wakaba,She'll be in our class from now on. ,1,1
Utena,"So, is Saionji going out with that Himemiya girl?",1,1
Wakaba,Not even! Tough old Saionji-sama could never have any feelings for a girl like her.,1,1
Wakaba,The only reason they're together is because they're both part of the Student Council.,1,1
Utena,"Wakaba... he's sort of your type, isn't he?",1,1
Wakaba,"Oh, I hate it when you get jealous! Don't you worry, I belong only to you.",1,1
Wakaba,"After all, you're much, much cooler than any boy!",1,1
Saionji,"This is a sudden meeting, fellow Councilors... ",1,1
Miki,"Saionji-san, we are the chosen members of the Rose Signet.",1,1

Touga,"Saionji, we have a problem with the way you've been treating the Bride recently.",1,1
Saionji,"Oh, is that so? ",1,1
Touga,"Certainly, she is engaged to you currently. ",1,1
Touga,"However, that doesn't mean you can do whatever you please to her.",1,1
Miki,"""Whatever he pleases?"" ",1,1
Juri,"""Whatever he pleases,"" you say? ",1,1
Touga,"Quit abusing the Bride, Saionji. ",1,1
Touga,The existence of our Student Council is the behest of the Ends of the World.,1,1
Touga,"Should they know of this matter, the Ends of the World will be displeased.",1,1
Saionji,Stay out of this. ,1,1
Saionji,"Presently, the Bride and I are deeply in love.",1,1
Saionji,I don't want to hear complaints from the likes of you.,1,1
Miki,"""Deeply in love?"" ",1,1
Anthy,"Right now, I am Saionji-sama's Bride. ",1,1
Anthy,I will do everything he wishes. ,1,1
Saionji,"Well, that's how it is between us. ",1,1
Saionji,"If you're so concerned with the Code, ",1,1
Saionji,"then win back the Bride in a duel in accordance with the Code, Councilors.",1,1
Touga,Don't forget that the next duel will be soon upon-,1,1
Saionji,I'm already looking forward to whoever it is that will challenge me.,1,1
Wakaba,"Ooh, that's so pretty... that rose pattern. ",1,1
Wakaba,"Say, that's our school emblem, isn't it?",1,1
Utena,Sure looks like it. ,1,1
Wakaba,Who'd you get it from? ,1,1
Utena,A prince on a white horse. ,1,1
Utena,"""This ring should guide thee to me."" ",1,1
Wakaba,What's that about? ,1,1
Utena,"I think someone said that to me when he gave me the ring,",1,1
Utena,"but I was real little then, so I don't remember too well.",1,1
Wakaba,I know what you mean. ,1,1
Wakaba,"When I was a little girl, my mama said to me,",1,1
Wakaba,"""You're the princess of the Onion Kingdom!"" ",1,1
Wakaba,and I actually believed her. ,1,1
Utena,"So your head's always been shaped like that, huh?",1,1
Wakaba,I wonder what that's about... ,1,1
crowd,Now what's this? ,1,1
Utena,What's going on here? ,1,1
boy,Someone's love letter got posted here. ,1,1
Utena,Love letter? ,1,1
boy,"hmmm, let's see... ""so then I was dancing with you in my dreams, Saionji-san.""",1,1
boy,"""You were smiling so gently. You must think I'm such an idiot.""",1,1
boy,Heh! I'll say! ,1,1
Utena,You guys are the idiots! ,1,1
Utena,This is such a tasteless thing to do. ,1,1
boy,"Hey, if it's up there, anybody would read it.",1,1
Utena,Nice guys wouldn't read this- ,1,1
Utena,Wakaba... ,1,1
Utena,Wakaba! ,1,1
Utena,YOU sent that letter to Saionji? ,1,1
Utena,That Saionji jerk is not getting away with this...,1,1
Saionji,How should I know? ,1,1
Saionji,Someone probably picked the letter out of the trash and posted it on their own.,1,1
Utena,Why did you throw it away in such a public place?,1,1
Saionji,What I do with my letters is my own business.,1,1
Saionji,"But, now that I think of it, ",1,1
Saionji,"if that sort of stupid, no, silly letter has amused anyone, then all the better.",1,1
Saionji,Was that all you wanted to talk about? ,1,1
Utena,No. ,1,1
Utena,"You're the captain of the Kendo Club, right?",1,1
Utena,You've got a duel with me today after school!,1,1
Saionji,What do you... ,1,1
Saionji,So that's it. ,1,1
Saionji,You're the next challenger. ,1,1
Utena,What do you mean by that? ,1,1
Saionji,"All right, then. ",1,1
Saionji,I'll meet you after classes at the Duel Arena in the forest at the rear of the school.,1,1
Utena,Forest? The one that's off-limits? ,1,1
Shadow,"I wonder, I wonder... do you know what I wonder?",1,1
Shadow,I hear there's going to be another duel out back in the forest today!,1,1
Shadow,"Oh, brave warrior, you're going to fight for your friend, meddlesome brave warrior!",1,1
Shadow,"But beware, brave warrior... ",1,1
Shadow,"They fight by a Code, there in the forest. ",1,1
Shadow,"Do you know that, I wonder? ",1,1
Shadow,"I wonder, I wonder... ",1,1
Shadow,Do you know what I wonder? ,1,1

Saionji,"So, this is your first time to see the castle, eh?",1,1
Utena,What is it? I sure couldn't see it from outside the forest.,1,1
Saionji,"It's a mirage, of sorts. ",1,1
Saionji,"You can think of it as magic, if you like.",1,1
Utena,A mirage? ,1,1
Saionji,What surprises me is someone outside the Student Council possessing a Rose Signet.,1,1

Utena,That Saionji guy was wearing a ring just like mine.,2,1
Utena,Do you know what it is? ,2,1
Anthy,All the Student Council members have one.,2,1
Anthy,It is the Rose Signet. ,2,1
Anthy,Anyone who has that ring is entitled to participate in the Duels.,2,1
Anthy,"So, since you are the current champion, ",2,1
Anthy,"one by one, you will be challenged to Duels by the other bearers of the Rose Signet.",2,1
Utena,You've gotta be kidding! ,2,1
Utena,No way I'm going to keep fighting those pointless duels!,2,1
Saionji,"Oh, it's you, Mr. President.",2,1
Touga,"Did I interrupt you, Mr. Vice-President? ",2,1
Saionji,"No. At least, you're enrolled in this club.",2,1
Touga,"So, is the captain of the Kendo Club going to fight the Junior High kid again?",2,1
Saionji,Of course. The power to revolutionize the world belongs to me.,2,1
Saionji,For someone like her to be engaged to the Bride would be a travesty.,2,1
Touga,"That can't be helped. No matter what you say, she...",2,1
Touga,"Himemiya Anthy, will become engaged to the Victor of the Duel.",2,1
Saionji,NO! She belongs to me! ,2,1
Saionji,She wrote explicitly in our exchange diary that she'd obey me forever.,2,1
Touga,So... you two kept an exchange diary? ,2,1
Utena,"Aw, man... ",2,1
Utena,There's really nobody but me and her in this dorm?,2,1
Utena,Is this also part of the Rose Signet Code?,2,1
Utena,Chuchu! Can you go bring her right away?,2,1
Utena,"If she doesn't show soon, I'll have to eat dinner all alone in this big old dining hall.",2,1
Saionji,"Why, Anthy!? ",2,1
Saionji,Why can't you obey me!? ,2,1
Anthy,"I'm sorry, Saionji-sempai. ",2,1
Anthy,It's because I'm engaged to Utena-sama now.,2,1
Saionji,"But when we were engaged, didn't you swear you'd dedicate yourself entirely to me?",2,1
Anthy,"True, but that's a thing of the past. ",2,1
Anthy,My engagement to you is over and done with.,2,1
Anthy,Please give up on it. ,2,1
Saionji,How shameless! ,2,1
Saionji,How shameless you are! ,2,1
Utena,You're the shameless one! ,2,1
Saionji,"Ah, you again. Well, this is fortuitous. ",2,1
Saionji,"In our last Duel, I let my guard down.",2,1
Saionji,Why don't we settle once and for all...,2,1
Saionji,"just who the Rose Bride will belong to, eh?",2,1
Saionji,"Tomorrow after school, we'll have a rematch at the Duel Arena.",2,1
Utena,That's insane. I'm not about to fight a Duel for no reason.,2,1
Utena,"Yesterday, I fought for my friend, Wakaba.",2,1
Utena,"I don't care about any of this ""Rose Bride"" stuff.",2,1
Saionji,"However, I do. ",2,1
Saionji,"And if you intend to stay engaged to the Bride as a Duelist,",2,1
Saionji,then you cannot refuse. ,2,1
Saionji,Those who disobey the rules of the Student Council will be expelled from the Academy.,2,1
Saionji,That's a school regulation. ,2,1
Utena,"Fine, then I accept. ",2,1
Utena,I'll meet you at the Duel Arena tomorrow after school.,2,1
Anthy,I thought you weren't going to accept any Duels...,2,1
Utena,"What could I do? If I didn't accept the Duel, I'd be kicked out of the Academy.",2,1
Utena,I'll just throw the Duel. ,2,1
Utena,"After that, no problem, right? ",2,1
Anthy,"Well, whatever you like. ",2,1
Shadow,"I wonder, I wonder... do you know what I wonder?",2,1
Shadow,There's going to be another duel out back in the forest today.,2,1
Shadow,The time has come to settle things once and for all.,2,1
Shadow,I'm done for... ,2,1
Shadow,"But it's okay, 'cause I lost on purpose! ",2,1
Shadow,"But beware, brave warrior, ",2,1

Nanami,But why did you give up on the idea of entering the contest?,4,1
Nanami,The teachers were disappointed. ,4,1
Miki,This piano seems a bit out of tune. ,4,1
Nanami,Does it? ,4,1
Nanami,It was just tuned last week. ,4,1
Miki,"Well, then maybe it's me that needs tuning.",4,1
Nanami,"You always play this piece when you're alone, don't you?",4,1
Miki,This piece is my only reason for playing the piano.,4,1
Miki,I keep playing because I want a certain someone to hear this music.,4,1
Nanami,A certain someone? ,4,1
Miki,"But, I can't play this piece quite the way I'd like.",4,1
Miki,"No matter what I do, it just doesn't sound like it should.",4,1
Nanami,How could that be? ,4,1
Nanami,It sounds just fine to me. ,4,1

Wakaba,"""Ladies leave all the logical thinking to the men.""",4,1
Utena,I see. ,4,1
Wakaba,You'll do fine since you're good at math.,4,1

Wakaba,"Plus, he's really popular with the older girls.",4,1

Juri,Hi. ,4,1
Miki,Juri-sempai. ,4,1
Juri,"I thought I'd find you in the club room or the Student Council office,",4,1
Juri,but here you are studying in the library. ,4,1
Juri,Are you correcting someone's test? ,4,1
Miki,"Yes, sort of. ",4,1
Juri,"Well, that's a change. You usually keep your distance from others.",4,1
Miki,"Say, Juri-sempai... ",4,1
Miki,"Do you suppose happiness is something close to us, after all?",4,1
Juri,"Anyway, this answer sheet is terrible! ",4,1
Juri,Whose is it? ,4,1

Utena,"Oh, then you're one of those Student Council guys?",4,1
Utena,"Then you must be after the Rose Bride, too.",4,1
Miki,"No, please don't get the wrong idea. ",4,1
Miki,"I am a member of the Student Council, ",4,1
Miki,but I have no intention of winning Himemiya-san as my bride by a duel.,4,1
Miki,I swear! ,4,1
Miki,These are the problems I expect for the make-up test.,4,1
Miki,"If you can memorize the formulas in this notebook, I'm sure you can pass.",4,1

Miki,looks a little like someone I know. ,4,1
Miki,That's all. ,4,1
Miki,"I have no intention of challenging you to a duel, Tenjou-sempai.",4,1
Utena,Of course! ,4,1
Utena,Do you know how much trouble you Student Council guys have caused us?,4,1
Utena,"I don't quite know what's going on, but by involving us in stupid things like duels,",4,1
Utena,we have to retake the test. ,4,1
Miki,"""We,"" you say? ",4,1
Miki,"You have to retake the test, too? ",4,1
Utena,Um... well... yes. ,4,1
Touga,"That sounds good, today. ",4,1

Shadow,when he found out that pro wrestling ,4,1
Shadow,and super sized garlic ramen ,4,1
Shadow,were my favorites... ,4,1
Shadow,"""Now I know what kind of girl you are,""",4,1

Miki,"Himemiya-san must really like to keep things neat, then.",4,1
Nanami,"Wow, I'm really impressed. ",4,1
Nanami,"Ok, just watch. ",4,1
Nanami,Think Himemiya Anthy's a cute girl while you can.,4,1
Miki,"I envy you, Tenjou-sempai, living with such a feminine girl.",4,1
Utena,Is that sarcasm? ,4,1
Nanami,"Himemiya-sempai, may I borrow your eraser?",4,1
Nanami,"A snail, it's a snail! ",4,1
Nanami,She has a snail in her pencil case! ,4,1

Nanami,"Namely, Operation ""Oh my gosh, Himemiya Anthy's a weirdo keeping a snail in her pencil case!""",4,1
Miki,Did you say something? ,4,1
Nanami,"No, nothing. ",4,1

Nanami,Sn- sn- sn- snails! There's snails in here!,4,1
Anthy,"Oh, that's a house for my snail friends. ",4,1

Miki,But it's cute. It's something I'd expect from Himemiya-san.,4,1
Nanami,"They're snails! You say it's cute, but they're snails!",4,1
Anthy,"Catherine, Juliet, Marcelina, I'll see you later.",4,1
Miki,"Do you get it, Tenjou-sempai? ",4,1
Miki,You made a mistake right here. ,4,1
Utena,Huh? Where? ,4,1
Miki,In this case... ,4,1
Nanami,"Well then, I have no other choice. ",4,1
Miki,"Look, you made the same mistake as before.",4,1

Anthy,"We're studying now, so I'll see you later, okay?",4,1
Anthy,Mr. Snake tasted yummy? I see... ,4,1

Anthy,"I felt sorry for it getting thrown away, so I hid it here.",4,1
Utena,Won't you please convince her to get rid of it?,4,1
Miki,But it's cute. It's something I'd expect from Himemiya-san.,4,1
Miki,"So, this becomes ""X=3."" ",4,1
Miki,"And if you substitute it in here, you can solve this linear problem.",4,1
Utena,"Oh, now I see! ",4,1

Anthy,It's my special recipe. ,4,1
Miki,Really? I'd better make a note of that.,4,1
Utena,I'd like a bit more syrup. ,4,1

Utena,"If you keep up these petty false accusations, ",8,1
Utena,I'll really become your enemy. ,8,1
Miki,It... it can't be... ,8,1
Miki,"The pure, innocent Himemiya-san has... ",8,1
Nanami,Switched personalities? ,8,1
Keiko,These are the hidden photos of them over the past days.,8,1
Aiko,"Himemiya Anthy, Tenjou Utena... their behaviour patterns are completely switched.",8,1
Nanami,"It's true, but how? ",8,1
Keiko,Everything dates back to that curry explosion. ,8,1
Nanami,"Utena is Anthy, and Anthy is Utena? ",8,1
Nanami,All because of that 900 Billion X spice... ,8,1
Nanami,That's crazy... ,8,1
girl,"Five, please. ",8,1
Aiko,That'll be 2000 yen. ,8,1
girl,Gallant Anthy is cooler than I expected. ,8,1
girl,"Calm Utena is attractive, too. ",8,1
Nanami,You're selling them...? ,8,1
Aiko,"Their charm is unexpected, isn't it? ",8,1
Keiko,They're popular with both boys and girls. ,8,1
Miki,My goodness! ,8,1
Miki,"This, this can't be Himemiya-san! ",8,1
Miki,"But, now that I've bought them, I can't stand myself.",8,1
Yuuko,"Okay, you wanted 20, right? ",8,1
Keiko,Thank you. ,8,1
Aiko,Thank you. ,8,1
Nanami,"Really, I don't see what's so great about her.",8,1
Touga,"I see, so that's how it is. ",8,1
Nanami,Onii-sama! ,8,1
Touga,"I thought it seemed suspicious, ",8,1
Touga,but I didn't think that you actually were involved in all this.,8,1
Nanami,"N- no, I, um, ah, well, that is... ",8,1
Aiko,Here are the negatives. ,8,1
Keiko,Thank you. ,8,1
Nanami,"Et tu, Onii-sama? ",8,1
Utena,"I see, so that's how it was. ",8,1
Utena,So you all were behind this. ,8,1
Touga,I'm afraid there's been a misunderstanding. ,8,1
Nanami,"That's right, a misunderstanding. ",8,1
Nanami,My brother would never make passes at you two.,8,1
Nanami,This was all MY doing. ,8,1
Touga,Nanami! ,8,1
Touga,You've gotten me into a very troubling situation.,8,1
Nanami,"Please forgive me, Onii-sama. ",8,1
Nanami,"When they were going to make delicious curry during Anthy-san's cooking practice,",8,1
Nanami,Nanami got this phantom Indian spice especially for them.,8,1
Nanami,But I can't believe it caused all of this.,8,1
Utena,You're the one I can't believe. ,8,1
Nanami,"If we could just get the phantom spice once more,",8,1
Nanami,I'm sure Utena-san and Anthy-san would be able to return to their old selves.,8,1
Nanami,"So, please, Onii-sama! ",8,1
Touga,Okay. You may not return until you once more have the phantom spice.,8,1
Nanami,"I understand. Thank you, Onii-sama. ",8,1
Keiko,"She said it but, I wonder where is the phantom spice?",8,1
Yuuko,"Well, it came from India, didn't it? ",8,1
Keiko,India?! ,8,1
Aiko,India?! ,8,1
Nanami,"Wait for me, Onii-sama! I shall return! ",8,1
Keiko,"You mean we're supposed to go with her, too?",8,1
Aiko,"You mean we're supposed to go with her, too?",8,1

Anthy,"Utena-sama, that's wonderful. ",8,1
Utena,"Well, it feels weird being praised by my own body.",8,1
Anthy,"You see, I'm not very good at sports, ",8,1
Anthy,so seeing my own body acting so wonderfully makes me happy.,8,1
Utena,"But, we gotta think of a way to return to normal.",8,1
Anthy,Don't worry. ,8,1
Anthy,I'm sure even now Nanami-san is...,8,1
Utena,"Anyway, it'll be bad if we don't find a way to return to our old bodies soon.",8,1
Utena,I don't want to be the victim of the Rose Signet.,8,1
Anthy,"I don't mind being like this, because I don't judge by outside appearances.",8,1
Utena,"Well, I do mind. Saionji has been coming on to me.",8,1
Saionji,"I've been waiting, Himemiya Anthy. ",8,1
Utena,"See, here he comes. ",8,1
Saionji,It's that time again. Follow me. ,8,1
Anthy,Could I go with you? ,8,1
Saionji,"You can stay here. Come on, Anthy. ",8,1
Nanami,You really helped me. When that elephant was chasing me I thought it was all over.,8,1
Nanami,"By the way, have you heard of the Phantom 900 Billion X spice?",8,1
man,Phantom? ,8,1
Saionji,I have longed for this day. ,8,1
Utena,"Oh, Himemiya, what are you usually doing with Saionji in a place like this?",8,1
Saionji,"Anthy, I'll get right to the point: I need you to keep your promise.",8,1
Utena,"Uh, what was that again? ",8,1
Saionji,"As always, you're good at teasing me. ",8,1
Saionji,"Well, if that's how you're going to be then I'll say it.",8,1
Saionji,Today is one of the two days that we prove our love each week.,8,1
Utena,Prove our love?! ,8,1
Saionji,The same as always. ,8,1
Utena,"W, wait a minute. ",8,1
Saionji,"Even if we defy fate itself, our bond is genuine.",8,1
Saionji,Even though we must keep it a secret for now.,8,1
Saionji,"Don't turn your eyes away. Look at me, the real me.",8,1
Utena,No! No! ,8,1
Saionji,Here you will see nothing but the truth... in our exchange diary.,8,1
Utena,Huh? Diary? ,8,1
Nanami,Phantom spice... ,8,1
Nanami,Phantom spice... ,8,1
Keiko,Nanami-sama! ,8,1
Nanami,An elephant? ,8,1
Saionji,"Now I am content with just this diary for the moment,",8,1
Saionji,"but someday, when I master the sword, I'll show everyone I can get you back.",8,1
Saionji,"Wait for that day, Anthy. ",8,1
Utena,That Saionji. He's serious. ,8,1
Utena,"I'm sure that since she knew his feelings, ",8,1
Utena,she just continued the diary for him and kept it a secret even from me.,8,1
Utena,"But, what can I do? ",8,1
Utena,"The best way would be to ask her to write a response to him,",8,1
Utena,but if I do that Saionji and Himemiya will know that I know their secret.,8,1
Utena,"And, of course, I can't write it myself. ",8,1
Anthy,"Ah, Saionji-sempai's exchange diary. ",8,1
Anthy,"Well, Utena-sama, please return it to Sempai.",8,1
Utena,"Huh? You mean, are you telling me to write it?",8,1
Anthy,Because now Utena-sama is Himemiya Anthy. ,8,1
Utena,I can't spy on your privacy. That's just wrong.,8,1
Anthy,Wrong? ,8,1
Utena,"Yeah, it's wrong. ",8,1
Anthy,"Well, then, I'll quit. ",8,1
Utena,"Wait a minute, what are you doing? That's a bit extreme.",8,1
Utena,You can't just throw it away! ,8,1
Anthy,"I was only continuing the diary because you never said to stop, Utena-sama.",8,1
Anthy,"Now that you've said it was wrong, Utena-sama, ",8,1
Anthy,I can't continue with Saionji- sempai's exchange diary.,8,1
Utena,What I want to say is... ,8,1
Anthy,Yes? ,8,1
Utena,"Well, Saionji has gotten to be really pathetic.",8,1
Anthy,Ah! ,8,1
Keiko,Nanami-sama! ,8,1
Nanami,Not again! ,8,1
Utena,"Ah, the only thing to do is write it. Let's see...",8,1
Utena,"Dear Anthy, even now I'm dreaming of the time you and I were engaged.",8,1
Utena,"Hey, look, he's really serious, isn't he?",8,1
Saionji,"To my beloved Anthy, ",8,1
Saionji,I'm sorry for making you wait all the time.,8,1
Saionji,"I'm satisfied with the diary for now, ",8,1
Saionji,"but surely I'll overthrow that impudent, ugly tomboy Tenjou...",8,1
Saionji,and surely I'll show them I can get you back.,8,1
Saionji,"By, Saionji Kyouichi. ",8,1
Utena,This ain't funny at all. ,8,1
Nanami,Where's the spice? The phantom spice? ,8,1
Keiko,Nanami-sama! ,8,1
Saionji,"Anthy, it's almost here, the day I return to a rose colored life with you.",8,1
Touga,"This is unusual, Saionji. You, showing your face at the rose garden...",8,1
Saionji,"Listen well, Touga. The Rose Bride will soon return to me.",8,1
Touga,"Oh, Anthy? ",8,1
Saionji,No one can tear apart our love... surely not even the Rose Signet Code.,8,1
Touga,"Oh, Anthy? ",8,1
Utena,Saionji-sempai! ,8,1
Saionji,"Oh, Anthy, I've been waiting for you. ",8,1
Utena,"Forgive me, but I couldn't stop laying bare all my thoughts.",8,1
Utena,"Please, take it. ",8,1
Saionji,"So, you think that much of me. I'll take only your true intentions. Well...",8,1
Miki,"Sempai, I just now heard that Nanami-san has returned.",8,1
Touga,What? ,8,1
Diary,Casanova ,8,1
Nanami,Onii-sama! ,8,1
Touga,"Nanami, you've become strong. ",8,1
Nanami,I found it! This is the phantom spice! ,8,1
Touga,"Well done, Nanami! ",8,1
Utena,"All right, with this we can return to our old selves!",8,1
Nanami,Onii-sama! ,8,1
Touga,Nanami! ,8,1
Touga,"Nanami, the replacement? ",8,1
Nanami,That was the last one. ,8,1
Nanami,They said it will take another 200 years to refine it to 900 Billion X spice.,8,1
Utena,200 years? ,8,1
Shadow,"Could this be a case of ""Reaping what you sow?""",8,1
Shadow,Could it be? ,8,1
Nanami,"The spice, the rare phantom spice I took all that trouble to obtain...",8,1
Utena,We'll be like this forever? ,8,1
Anthy,"Now, now, everyone please don't get depressed. ",8,1
Anthy,Please have some of my special curry and try to cheer up.,8,1
Utena,I don't really feel like eating curry but...,8,1
Keiko,Nanami-sama... ,8,1
Nanami,What is it? Silence! ,8,1
Keiko,"I'm sorry but, look at this. ",8,1
Miki,Th- That's... ,8,1
Nanami,The phantom 900 Billion X spice. ,8,1
Utena,What? ,8,1
Aiko,It was left in the cooking room. ,8,1
Aiko,Unopened... ,8,1
Keiko,It looks like it was never used in that curry.,8,1
Utena,So that means that explosion... ,8,1
Nanami,wasn't caused by the spice... ,8,1
Utena,It was from Anthy's cooking skills? ,8,1
Nanami,It was from Anthy's cooking skills? ,8,1
Miki,"That's incredible, Himemiya-san! ",8,1
Miki,"This is a new invention, curry that explodes and causes a personality switch when eaten.",8,1
Anthy,"Oh, you're embarrassing me. ",8,1
Utena,Saionji... ,8,1
Saionji,"Anthy, what is this? ",8,1
Saionji,Since when would you so calmly write such shameless things?,8,1
Saionji,"That's it, it's because you've been living with that vulgar Tenjou Utena.",8,1
Saionji,"Now I see, Anthy. ",8,1
Saionji,"I'll pretend I never read that, so please re- write it. Fill a new page with words of love.",8,1
Anthy,"Well, how is the curry? ",8,1
Anthy,"It's a new invention, you know. ",8,1
Saionji,"Yes, it's just right this time. ",8,1
Utena,"That, that curry is... ",8,1
Anthy,My new invention. ,8,1
Wakaba,"So, when you came to after the explosion's shock you were both your old selves again?",8,1
Utena,You got it. ,8,1
Wakaba,"Huh, unbelievable. ",8,1

Touga,I'm always on the girl's side... ,9,1
Touga,...because I am a gentleman. ,9,1

girl,"I'll never see anyone, or come out into the sun again.",9,1
Saionji,Wait! Don't you think she might do something stupid if we leave her like that?,9,1
Touga,"Then, why don't you show her something eternal?",9,1
Saionji,"The next day, she'd come out of the coffin.",9,1
Saionji,And there was something about the look in her eyes...,9,1
Saionji,Did you do something to her after what happened yesterday?,9,1
Touga,"No, nothing. ",9,1
Saionji,"However, I thought for sure that he must've shown her something eternal.",9,1

Touga,Castle? ,9,1

Saionji,I'm the one keeping the promise with you.,9,1
Anthy,Promise? ,9,1
Saionji,"Correct. Tonight, we'll finally be able to go to the castle said to hold eternity.",9,1
Anthy,"No, you mustn't. ",9,1
Anthy,It's not allowed for anyone not engaged to me to take me to the duel arena without the arrangement ofa duel.,9,1

Mamiya,"Say, Sempai... ",14,2
Mamiya,I've heard that Student Council President Kiryuu has been absent from school lately.,14,2
Mamiya,It would explain why the academy has been so quiet recently.,14,2

Utena,Hi. Where have you been? ,14,2
Anthy,At school. ,14,2
Utena,I see. ,14,2
Utena,It seems like you're never around most weekend nights. Is something going on?,14,2
Anthy,"Yes, because I've been told that we should meet at least once a week.",14,2
Utena,Meet who? ,14,2
Anthy,My older brother. ,14,2
Utena,Ohh... ,14,2
Utena,What?! You have a brother?! ,14,2
Utena,Excuse us! ,14,2
Utena,"Oops, wrong floor. ",14,2
Anthy,"No, this is the place. ",14,2
Utena,"So, this is the Trustee Chairman's Office... ",14,2
Utena,Looks like a tough place to keep clean. ,14,2
Utena,That's huge! Is this your brother? ,14,2
Anthy,"No, this is a planetarium projector. ",14,2
Utena,Huh? ,14,2
Anthy,Utena-sama? ,14,2
Utena,Shh... ,14,2
Utena,"Bad timing, Himemiya. They're making out.",14,2
Utena,Let's split before we get in the way. ,14,2
Akio,Pleased to meet you. I'm Ohtori Akio. ,14,2
Utena,Pardon me. I'm Tenjou Utena. Pardon me. ,14,2
Akio,Not at all. It was good of you to come. ,14,2
Akio,I'm glad because this is the first time my sister has introduced a friend of hers to me.,14,2
Utena,No way... You're Ohtori Academy's - ,14,2
Akio,No. I'm just the Deputy Trustee Chairman. ,14,2
Akio,The real Trustee Chairman is Kanae-san's father.,14,2
Kanae,"My father is quite taken with Akio-san, ",14,2
Kanae,and he intends to let me marry him as soon as I've graduated high school.,14,2
Utena,"Well, congratulations. ",14,2
Akio,"I keep telling her it's too soon, but... ",14,2
Utena,I never knew the Trustee Chairman's Office was like this.,14,2
Akio,"In truth, I'm best suited to spending my time watching the sky.",14,2
Utena,"You like the stars, then? ",14,2
Kanae,So much so that it's almost abnormal. ,14,2
Kanae,And it's been rumored that he was adopted into my family just for this equipment.,14,2
Kanae,I hear he stayed here again last night. ,14,2
Akio,Stars are nice. ,14,2
Akio,"Look through the telescope at those familiar stars, and you can see the true faces that no one knows.",14,2
Kanae,"Remember me too once in a while, okay? ",14,2
Akio,"If I discover a comet, I'll name it after you.",14,2
Kanae,"Really, you're such a hopeless guy. ",14,2
Akio,"I haven't been here long, but there is one thing I do know...",14,2
Akio,"The students of this academy are all free, have a love of learning,",14,2
Akio,"and above all, do not fight. ",14,2
Akio,Right? ,14,2
Utena,I hope it always stays that way. ,14,2
Kanae,Nothing bad ever happens at Ohtori Academy. ,14,2

Anthy,All right. ,14,2
Professor,"Thank you, Mikage-kun. ",14,2
Professor,"Thanks to your paper, our research lab was selected as the consultative body.",14,2
Mikage,"That wasn't my paper, but rather yours, Professor.",14,2
Professor,"Hey, hurry up with the gift! ",14,2
Professor,"My wife went to a spa a few days ago, and she insisted I give you this.",14,2
Professor,Hey. ,14,2
Professor,Sorry for the runaround... ,14,2
Professor,"This might not be enough, but we'd like you to accept it.",14,2
Mikage,There's no need to pay me. ,14,2
Mikage,"Instead, I may ask you for your help someday soon.",14,2
Mikage,I'll be counting on you then. ,14,2
Professor,"Of course, we'll cooperate with you in whatever way we can.",14,2
Professor,So that was the charismatic high schooler who hosts the Mikage Seminar.,14,2
Professor,What an overpowering presence! I was scared stiff.,14,2
Professor,"The Mikage Seminar, also known as the Black Rose Society...",14,2
Professor,It's not just a rumor that there's even a career bureaucrat who's a member.,14,2
Professor,"As recipients of his favor, we college faculty can't say it's anyone else's business.",14,2
Professor,"Genius high schooler, Mikage Souji... ",14,2
Mikage,"So tell me, have you thought about our last conversation?",14,2
Miki,Y- Yes... ,14,2
Mikage,I could hardly wait. So? ,14,2
Miki,"I deeply appreciate your kind offer, ",14,2
Miki,"but I'm afraid I'm unworthy of your seminar, Mikage-sempai.",14,2
Mikage,I see. ,14,2
Mikage,An excellent intellect like yours would have been just the thing I was looking for.,14,2
Mikage,"But, if that's your position, okay. ",14,2
Mikage,Tell me if you ever change your mind. You won't regret it.,14,2
Miki,Thank you very much. See you later. ,14,2
Anthy,"Thank you very much, Utena-sama. ",14,2
Utena,Huh? What for? ,14,2
Anthy,For not telling my brother about my secrets. ,14,2
Utena,"Oh, that. ",14,2
Anthy,I don't want him to know about anything that might worry him.,14,2
Anthy,"Like me being the Rose Bride, or the Duellist's Code...",14,2
Utena,I get it. ,14,2
Utena,It's best for us to keep these things secret from your brother.,14,2
Utena,"Kanae-san looks to be a nice person, too. It'd be a shame if they got caught up in it.",14,2
Utena,"Now, let's go home. ",14,2
Miki,"Oh, Tenjou-sempai, Himemiya-san! ",14,2
Utena,Micky! ,14,2
Anthy,Hello. ,14,2
Miki,Don't you have today off? ,14,2
Utena,We went to see Himemiya's brother. ,14,2
Miki,"I see... the Trustee Chairman, hmm? ",14,2
Utena,"How about you, Micky? What are you up to?",14,2
Miki,"Well, I had to do some research in the archives here...",14,2
Utena,"Wow, you even like studying on holidays! ",14,2
Utena,I never even knew this place existed. ,14,2
Miki,You don't know about Nemuro Memorial Hall? ,14,2
Miki,It's a building with quite a history behind it.,14,2
Utena,A history? ,14,2
Miki,It's said that a hundred boys were buried alive here a long time ago.,14,2
Mikage,"Say, Mamiya... it seems that you're eligible to be the Rose Bride.",14,2
Mamiya,"Don't you mean ""Groom?"" I am a boy. ",14,2
Mikage,"""Bride"" suits you better. ",14,2
Mikage,I will definitely make you a real bride. ,14,2
Mikage,And then I'll obtain the Power of Dios and make the secret of eternity ours.,14,2
Mamiya,"If you say so, Sempai. ",14,2
Mikage,It's all right. We've been acknowledged by the Ends of the World.,14,2
Mikage,"But to do all that, ",14,2
Mikage,"we must defeat Tenjou Utena and obtain Himemiya Anthy,",14,2
Mikage,and then we must kill her. ,14,2
Mamiya,Then we'll need a skillful Duelist. ,14,2

Kanae,"He is someone that my father, the Trustee Chairman, recommended.",14,2
Kanae,"He... He's very gentle, and can be a little childish, but...",14,2
Kanae,"In fact, he's so much more mature than I am, and he watches over me ever so kindly.",14,2
Kanae,I would do anything for him. ,14,2
Kanae,I believe this from the bottom of my heart.,14,2
Kanae,But... But... ,14,2
Mikage,Deeper... ,14,2
Mikage,Go deeper... ,14,2
Kanae,But... ,14,2
Kanae,"But, he has a younger sister, ",14,2
Kanae,"and no matter how hard I try, I can't bring myself to like her.",14,2
Kanae,There was this incident... ,14,2
Kanae,"When I gave her my cherished scarf and told her to use it,",14,2
Kanae,"she said ""Thank you,"" and began wiping her glasses with it!",14,2
Kanae,"I was so surprised, and when I told her it wasn't a lens cloth,",14,2
Kanae,she simply stared at me silently and smiled.,14,2
Kanae,"The sight of her eyes made my skin crawl, because she looked totally like an alien!",14,2
Kanae,And my father... ,14,2
Kanae,I can't help but feel that my father's illness started when that freak came to our house.,14,2
Kanae,I'm not sure if I can keep smiling around her any longer.,14,2
Kanae,Up until now I've done my best to like her...,14,2
Kanae,But I just can't! ,14,2
Kanae,No matter how hard I try... ,14,2
Kanae,I CAN'T! ,14,2
Mikage,I understand. I suppose you have no choice but to revolutionize the world.,14,2
Mikage,The way before you has been prepared. ,14,2

Mikage,But I think black is more beautiful. ,14,2
Mamiya,You can't run away now. ,14,2
Mamiya,Because you have been chosen... by my Black Rose.,14,2

Juri,"According to him, he wasn't certain whether or not it was an accident.",15,2
Juri,"However, just last night, he got a phone call saying that next time, it wouldn't be just a slight accident.",15,2
Kozue,"How brilliant, Arisugawa-sempai. You seem to know everything.",15,2
Juri,There are things I don't know. ,15,2

Akio,"Well, she is my sister. ",15,2
Akio,"However, if she is enjoying her school life, then I'm relieved.",15,2
Akio,I'm glad that my sister has good friends like you.,15,2
Utena,"Akio-san, you really think about your sister a lot, don't you?",15,2
Akio,Do I? ,15,2
Utena,"I probably wouldn't understand since I don't have any siblings myself,",15,2
Utena,...but what does it mean for a girl to have an older brother?,15,2
Utena,What's this? ,15,2
Utena,The moon? ,15,2

Akio,"But, every now and then, you look up at it and feel a certain degree of comfort.",15,2
Miki,"Himemiya-san, not here yet? ",15,2
Miki,I must have arrived a little early. ,15,2

Kozue,"Lately, even though he pretends there's nothing wrong,",15,2
Kozue,"...if something happens to sully me, he acts outwardly as if everything's okay.",15,2
Kozue,"But in his heart, he's hurt and he obsesses over me.",15,2
Kozue,That's why I purposely go out with people that I know Miki would hate.,15,2
Kozue,However... ,15,2
Souji,Deeper. Go deeper. ,15,2
Kozue,"But, Miki's attention is gradually going to that other woman.",15,2

Utena,What you're doing now is what exactly a cow does!,16,2
Nanami,Cow? ,16,2

Utena,That's an awful thing to say. ,19,2
Wakaba,"He's still what he was. He's always chasing tail, flirting with the girls.",19,2

girl,Wakaba! ,19,2
Wakaba,She told me to return this. ,19,2
Wakaba,"To begin with, Utena and Tatsuya are not a good match.",19,2
Tatsuya,It's 'cause you said something weird. ,19,2
Wakaba,What're you talking about? ,19,2
Tatsuya,'Cause you told Tenjou-san about weird stuff like Prince Pumpkin or something.,19,2
Wakaba,It's Prince Onion. ,19,2
Tatsuya,It doesn't matter whichever it is. ,19,2
Wakaba,It does matter! ,19,2
Wakaba,It does matter. It's important to me. ,19,2

Nanami,"Therefore, the form of love is eternal. ",19,2
Nanami,Onii-sama... ,19,2

Juri,"If you could easily switch whom you love, you two would be able to feel more relief.",19,2
Juri,I guess that goes for me too. ,19,2
Utena,I'm still wondering if he is the prince that Wakaba said she can't get her mind off.,19,2
Akio,What're we talking about? ,19,2
Utena,"Well, my friend happened to reunite with her childhood friend.",19,2
Utena,"See, they're not being honest about it, ",19,2
Utena,...and I'm wondering if the prince she's waiting for isn't really him.,19,2
Akio,That's a lovely story. ,19,2
Utena,"Oh, I'm sorry, I'm always the one to talk here.",19,2
Akio,I don't mind. ,19,2

Akio,"It seems like you could see through, but in fact you can't.",19,2
Akio,The prince people hold inside their heart... ,19,2
Akio,...is surely something that others wouldn't understand.,19,2
Akio,"But, I envy young people who are in love. ",19,2
Akio,"I hope you, too, will find your own prince soon, Anthy.",19,2
Anthy,"Yes, Onii-sama. ",19,2

Utena,Somehow...? ,19,2
Wakaba,Yep. ,19,2
Utena,Have some tea and make do? ,19,2
Wakaba,Yep. ,19,2
Utena,"I got it. I'll do it for a certain someone's sake, too.",19,2
Wakaba,What's that supposed to mean? ,19,2
Tatsuya,Hello! Sorry I'm late. ,19,2
Wakaba,You're late! How long were you going to make us wait?,19,2
Tatsuya,"Sorry, sorry. ",19,2

Anthy,"Hello, I'm Himemiya. ",19,2
Anthy,And this is Chuchu. ,19,2
Tatsuya,"Hello, I'm Kazami Tatsuya. Pleased to meet you, Chuchu.",19,2
Wakaba,What's the use of making eyes at a monkey? ,19,2
Tatsuya,What's that supposed to mean? ,19,2
Wakaba,That part of you hasn't changed one bit.,19,2
Tatsuya,Stop talking like that in front of everyone.,19,2
Wakaba,"But it's true, isn't it? You're always cozying up to girls.",19,2
Tatsuya,That wasn't what I... ,19,2
Tatsuya,"What about you, Wakaba? Why are you accusing me like that? It's strange.",19,2
Wakaba,I... ,19,2
Wakaba,"Never mind, it's nothing. ",19,2
Tatsuya,What is it? ,19,2
Wakaba,It's nothing. ,19,2
Tatsuya,"If you want to say something, then say it!",19,2
Wakaba,"I'm telling you, it's nothing! ",19,2
Wakaba,"Come on, you have something to say to Utena, don't you?",19,2
Tatsuya,Yeah. ,19,2
Tatsuya,"Say, Tenjou-san, are you seeing someone at the moment?",19,2
Utena,"I'm not dating anyone right now, ",19,2
Utena,...but I'm still thinking about the prince that gave me this ring long ago.,19,2
Tatsuya,"Prince, huh? That's kind of nice and dreamy.",19,2
Utena,"Speaking of which, it seems the princess near you now has a prince she can't stop thinking of.",19,2
Utena,"Right, Wakaba? ",19,2
Wakaba,"Wh- What are you talking about, Utena? ",19,2
Utena,"Prince Onion is nice and dreamy, right? ",19,2
Wakaba,No way! ,19,2
Wakaba,My prince is... ,19,2
Wakaba,My prince is... ,19,2
Wakaba,He is... ,19,2
Utena,"Why don't you become a little more honest, Wakaba?",19,2
Wakaba,"That's not it{\i0}! Ooh, Utena, you're just picking on me!",19,2
Tatsuya,A- Wakaba! ,19,2
Tatsuya,"Um, Tenjou-san? ",19,2
Utena,What? ,19,2
Tatsuya,"What did you mean when you said ""Wakaba's prince"" just now?",19,2
Utena,"She's pretending to be strong, but she is a girl after all.",19,2
Utena,It might be that she can't forget about the prince she met so long ago.,19,2
Wakaba,I have Prince Onion on my side! ,19,2
Wakaba,"To me, it's a precious memory, so... ",19,2
Tatsuya,Tenjou-san... ,19,2
Utena,What? ,19,2
Tatsuya,"Actually, when I transferred to this academy, I knew Wakaba was here.",19,2
Tatsuya,She hasn't changed at all since the days I knew her.,19,2
Tatsuya,"You were always right next to her all the time she looked happy, Tenjou-san.",19,2
Tatsuya,If I could be with you... ,19,2
Utena,"Then you could be with Wakaba, too? ",19,2
Utena,"So that's why you sent me a love-letter, isn't it?",19,2
Tatsuya,I'm sorry. That girl's so shy. ,19,2
Tatsuya,"I thought she was only calling me Prince Onion to make fun of me,",19,2
Tatsuya,"...but I was wrong, wasn't I? ",19,2
Utena,"Well, I don't know any further than that. ",19,2
Utena,The prince people hold inside their heart... ,19,2
Utena,...is surely something that others wouldn't understand.,19,2
Utena,But I think it's worth it to confess. ,19,2
Tatsuya,Thank you very much! ,19,2
Utena,But did I do the right thing? ,19,2
Anthy,About what? ,19,2
Utena,About Tatsuya-kun and Wakaba. ,19,2

Wakaba,My prince's feelings? ,19,2
Tatsuya,"But, just as you finally realized your own feelings,",19,2
Tatsuya,"...maybe you have already realized your prince's feelings, too.",19,2
Wakaba,Can a childhood friend find even that out?,19,2
Tatsuya,Of course. ,19,2
Wakaba,You're right. ,19,2
Wakaba,You're right. I've finally realized that I really was in love with that prince.,19,2

Wakaba,Maybe...maybe finally I can become happy too.,19,2

Tatsuya,You can become happy. ,19,2

Wakaba,...his heart has belonged to that girl from the start.,20,2
Wakaba,"That girl, with her face that says she alone is special,",20,2
Wakaba,will steal everything and anything away from me.,20,2
Wakaba,I simply can't bring myself to forgive her.,20,2
Wakaba,"Whether in love, or my studies, in the end I'm just another face in the crowd.",20,2
Wakaba,My world is completely different from that of the special people.,20,2
Wakaba,"But... but... If he's there, if he's with me, then I am special.",20,2
Wakaba,"Just a little bit longer, and I would have been reborn.",20,2
Wakaba,"That, that, that girl... ",20,2
Wakaba,That girl... ,20,2
Mikage,I understand. ,20,2
Mikage,I suppose you have no choice but to revolutionize the world.,20,2
Mikage,The way before you has been prepared. ,20,2
Mikage,So... ,20,2
Saionji,I didn't think he'd ask me to bring him that thing to grant my wish.,20,2
Saionji,"Of course, I knew I couldn't stay in this sort of place forever.",20,2
Saionji,Okay! Ready to go! ,20,2
Saionji,"Saionji Kyouichi, heading for a new era of glory... moving out!",20,2
Wakaba,Going somewhere? ,20,2
Saionji,"Ah, what... ",20,2
Saionji,I was wondering who it was. I'm sorry for inconveniencing you all this time.,20,2
Saionji,I'm returning to the world I used to know.,20,2
Wakaba,Where is that hairclip? ,20,2
Saionji,"Oh, something happened, so I can't give it to you anymore.",20,2
Saionji,"But, don't worry, I plan to buy you something expensive instead,",20,2
Saionji,"...and I want to mail it to you if I can, so is this address okay?",20,2

Keiko,I have always been watching Touga-sama. ,21,2
Keiko,Always... ,21,2
Keiko,The only one who can approach the prince is the princess from the wonder world.,21,2
Keiko,Touga-sama... He lives in a different world from mine.,21,2
Keiko,Right. A girl like me... ,21,2
Utena,"Touga looked better than we thought, didn't he?",21,2
Miki,But he still doesn't show himself in the academy.,21,2
Utena,"The way the president is, the Student Council must be in trouble.",21,2
Nanami,"Oh, are you so worried about my brother... ",21,2
Nanami,...that you sneak around and spy on him?,21,2
Nanami,How disgusting. ,21,2
Utena,Don't be ridiculous! Who did anything like that?!,21,2
Keiko,"My, my. Are you playing dumb? ",21,2
Yuuko,You were talking about him just now. What nerve!,21,2
Utena,I went to the party because I was invited! ,21,2
Nanami,"My, I just thought, ""Even a dead tree may add to the beauty of a mountain,"" and you got conceited.",21,2
Nanami,What impudent people there are in this world!,21,2
Utena,Now look... ,21,2
Keiko,Why don't you try to think about your own standing?,21,2
Aiko,I'll say! ,21,2
Yuuko,I'll say! ,21,2
Nanami,I can't stand it to even think about a girl like you hanging around my brother.,21,2
Nanami,"Right, I won't allow even a single insect to swarm on my brother.",21,2
Nanami,"Shall we go, everyone? ",21,2
Miki,"I'm sorry, Tenjou-sempai. ",21,2
Utena,"Don't apologize, Micky. It happens all the time.",21,2
Anthy,"I'm sorry, um... Was I sleeping? Was I?",21,2
Utena,"Chuchu was crying all last night, wasn't he?",21,2
Utena,"You see, the open cluster Pleiades... ",21,2
Utena,"...is known as Subaru in Japan, and is even mentioned in Sei Shounagon's ""Pillow Book.""",21,2
Anthy,"That's pretty detailed, Utena-sama. ",21,2
Utena,"Well, that's just what Akio-san told me. I've been studying from him closely of late.",21,2
Anthy,I see. ,21,2
Akio,"Wonderful, aren't they? The winter constellations... ",21,2
Anthy,Onii-sama... ,21,2
Akio,Friendship is beautiful. ,21,2
Akio,"Castor and Pollux of the Gemini are known to be very friendly with each other, but...",21,2
Akio,"The way you're watching the stars together, you look even more beautiful than the Gemini.",21,2
Utena,"Oh, that can't be... ",21,2
Utena,"Well, I'm outta here. ",21,2
Anthy,"All right, Utena-sama. ",21,2
Akio,"All right, Anthy, you should continue to be friendly with Utena-san.",21,2
Akio,Just like Castor and Pollux of the Gemini. ,21,2
Anthy,"Yes, Onii-sama. ",21,2
Keiko,What should I do? Touga-sama is getting soaked.,21,2
Keiko,Lend him my umbrella... ,21,2
Keiko,But a girl like me and Touga-sama? ,21,2
Keiko,But a chance like this won't come again. ,21,2
Keiko,"Excuse me, Touga-sama? ",21,2
Keiko,"If it's okay, won't you join me? ",21,2
Keiko,The rain is bad for your health. ,21,2
Keiko,"Nanami-sama? It's me, Nanami-sama. ",21,2
Keiko,"Where are you, Nanami-sama? ",21,2
Nanami,"I'm right here, Keiko-san. ",21,2
Keiko,Nanami-sama... ,21,2
Keiko,You said you wanted to see me? ,21,2
Nanami,"Sonoda Keiko-san, you are now dismissed from all clubs,",21,2
Nanami,"the dorm's self-government association, culture circles, and all the other organizations you belong to.",21,2
Keiko,"Why is that, Nanami-sama? ",21,2
Nanami,Why?! ,21,2
Nanami,Don't play dumb! ,21,2
Nanami,How careless I was! The real troublesome insect was right under my feet!,21,2
Nanami,To think that I didn't notice until today!,21,2
Keiko,Nanami-sama... ,21,2
Nanami,"I told you, I won't allow even a single insect to swarm on my brother.",21,2
Nanami,I'll thoroughly exterminate all troublesome insects like you.,21,2
Keiko,"Oh, no... ",21,2
Nanami,"Please prepare yourself, Keiko-san. ",21,2
Yuuko,Nanami-sama is about to leave. ,21,2
Aiko,"We should leave, too. ",21,2
Keiko,Yuuko! Aiko! ,21,2
Keiko,"Please, you two intercede with Nanami-sama for me!",21,2
Keiko,You're the only ones who can help me! ,21,2
Keiko,Please! ,21,2
Yuuko,Did you hear something? ,21,2
Aiko,Not a thing. ,21,2
Keiko,I admired Nanami-sama from the bottom of my heart.,21,2
Keiko,"That's what I believed, and I've been serving her.",21,2
Keiko,"But actually, that wasn't true. ",21,2
Keiko,"I was only with Nanami-sama to get close to Touga-sama, even the littlest bit.",21,2
Keiko,"Without that reason, who'd want to be with her?",21,2
Mikage,Deeper... Go deeper. ,21,2
Keiko,That selfish... ,21,2
Keiko,I'm a single girl! What's wrong with me falling in love with someone?,21,2
Keiko,Why do I have to hold back because of her?,21,2
Keiko,"Just because she's Touga-sama's sister, she monopolizes his love.",21,2
Keiko,Even right before my own eyes! ,21,2
Keiko,And that girl has no idea... ,21,2
Keiko,...how I felt all this time! ,21,2
Keiko,She doesn't even try to understand! ,21,2
Mikage,I understand. ,21,2
Mikage,I suppose you have no choice but to revolutionize the world.,21,2
Mikage,The way before you has been prepared. ,21,2
Keiko,Where am I? ,21,2
Keiko,Touga-sama... ,21,2

Keiko,"Now, draw your sword! ",21,2
Utena,...the power to revolutionize the world! ,21,2
Utena,Why are you... ,21,2
Keiko,You should know well what kind of girl Nanami is.,21,2
Keiko,She doesn't even think of a girl like me as a person.,21,2
Keiko,"Knowing that, I've been serving her anyway. ",21,2
Utena,But I don't understand - why Touga's sword?,21,2
Keiko,You don't need to know! ,21,2
Keiko,"Can you beat this sword, Tenjou Utena? ",21,2
Keiko,"This sword, Touga-sama's sword! ",21,2
Keiko,The noblest sword in the world! ,21,2
Keiko,"With this sword, I will attain the great power.",21,2
Keiko,"And then, I will kill that girl! ",21,2
Keiko,I'll kill that Nanami who stands between Touga-sama and me!,21,2
Keiko,That's right. The real troublesome insect is Nanami!,21,2
Keiko,I see. That girl is a troublesome insect. ,21,2
Utena,I don't even know her name. ,21,2

Miki,"...as representatives of an autonomous body, to maintain order within the Academy.",22,2
Nanami,So true. Just who are these people who manipulate regular students and force them to duel TenjouUtena one after the other?,22,2
Juri,You're rather impatient. ,22,2
Juri,"Because your friends, and even Touga, have been targeted?",22,2
Nanami,"As usual, you know everything. ",22,2

Mikage,Pleased to meet you. I've had an interest in you for quite some time.,22,2
Mikage,"I'm Mikage Souji, from the High School. ",22,2
Utena,Mikage? You're the brilliant high school student who runs the Mikage Seminar?,22,2
Mikage,"What do you say, Tenjou Utena-san? ",22,2
Mikage,Do you not feel like joining the Seminar? ,22,2
Utena,"Who, me? I... My last test was a makeup, you see...",22,2
Mikage,This has nothing to do with academic prowess. My Seminar only seeks students with individual personalities.,22,2
Mikage,"You're perfectly welcome to come and see what it's like, at least.",22,2
Utena,"Your Seminar is held in this building here, isn't it?",22,2
Mikage,"Yes, it is. Nemuro Memorial Hall. ",22,2
Mikage,"I guess you've heard all the rumors concerning this building, haven't you?",22,2
Mikage,"If you're thinking about the story of a hundred boys dying here, that's true.",22,2
Mikage,"Long ago, there was a man known as Professor Nemuro.",22,2
Mikage,"There was a fire here, and his students were trapped inside and burned to death, they say.",22,2
Mikage,And this Nemuro Memorial Hall was remodeled sometime after.,22,2

Mikage,...that happened a long time ago. ,22,2

Utena,Akio-san? You here? ,22,2
Utena,He's not here... how strange. ,22,2
Mikage,"Oh, you... ",22,2
Mikage,I've done nothing more than make a deal with you.,22,2
Mikage,There's no reason for me to obey your orders.,22,2
Akio,True. That is our contract. ,22,2
Akio,Ever since that time... ,22,2
boy,"It doesn't seem to disappear too quickly, does it, Professor Nemuro?",22,2
Mikage,"Eh, what's that? ",22,2
boy,"I was talking about the snow, Professor. ",22,2
Mikage,"Stop calling me Professor. We're about the same age, you know.",22,2
boy,But the distinction is important. ,22,2
boy,"With a genius like you here, our project has been jumpstarted.",22,2
Mikage,"Really now, you're making too much of it.",22,2
boy,"Putting that aside, I didn't think they were this extreme in the secrecy.",22,2
boy,"We're being treated like spare parts, so to speak.",22,2
Mikage,Didn't you agree to that when you made your contract with the Academy?,22,2
boy,"Yes, but we don't even know the research subject of our neighboring section.",22,2
boy,"Rumor has it that it has something to do with ""the power to revolutionize the world,"" or some researchabout ""grasping eternity.""",22,2
boy,Can't you even give us at least a hint? ,22,2
Mikage,Even I don't know anything beyond the rumors.,22,2
Mikage,"Furthermore, I'm not even interested. ",22,2
Mikage,"By the way, there's been something I've been meaning to ask.",22,2
boy,What is it? ,22,2
Mikage,What is that ring all of you wear on your left hands?,22,2
boy,"Oh, no special meaning. ",22,2
boy,It's the latest fashion. ,22,2
boy,"So that's Professor Nemuro, the genius? And he really doesn't know about our current research subject?",22,2
boy,"Looks that way. But, the Professor's intellect is warranted by you-know-who.",22,2
boy,"His thesis is interesting, but the man himself is quite dry.",22,2
boy,People who act like they don't care about anything are unsophisticated.,22,2
boy,Let him act how he wants. That man is just like a computer.,22,2
boy,We should use him for all he's worth. ,22,2
Mikage,"At the time, I certainly was a computer-like man.",22,2
Mikage,"Though the computer is a peerless machine, machines themselves hold no purpose.",22,2
Mikage,"My dry self, those dry days... ",22,2
Mikage,And it is also true that I wasn't particularly interested in the research at that time.,22,2
Mikage,"And that which I participated in as a result wasn't progressing, but I didn't mind.",22,2
Tokiko,"You're the Research Coordinator, Professor Nemuro, right?",22,2
Tokiko,I was sent by the Board of Directors. ,22,2
Tokiko,"I'm here as their current inspector, Chida Tokiko. Pleased to meet you.",22,2
Tokiko,The streets around here are bad. ,22,2
Tokiko,"It must have been difficult, with the roads all slushy.",22,2
Mikage,"Yes, well... ",22,2
Mikage,"You've called me all the way out to your house, so what do you want?",22,2
Tokiko,It's too strong. ,22,2
Tokiko,"The tea seems a bit too strong, ",22,2
Tokiko,...even though I let it steam the same amount of time I usually do.,22,2
Tokiko,I wonder if even an hourglass can run slow.,22,2
Mikage,This job I was given is running its course as planned.,22,2
Mikage,"I can't guarantee completion, however. ",22,2
Tokiko,I know that you're not one for taking orders from others.,22,2
Tokiko,Genius is a godly thing. ,22,2
Tokiko,Its spirit can't be tied down to earth. ,22,2
Mikage,I'm not a genius. ,22,2
Tokiko,Why are you contributing to this project? ,22,2
Mikage,Purely for business reasons. ,22,2
Mikage,"As it is, I think I'm already working beyond my contract.",22,2
Mikage,"We've got one hundred excellent youths gathered together at Ohtori Academy, all pursuing this research.",22,2
Mikage,"They are saying that the purpose of this research is for the power to revolutionize the world,",22,2
Mikage,"...or to grasp eternity, or something like that.",22,2
Mikage,To even think of grasping eternity... ,22,2
Mikage,It sounds like they're trying to build a perpetual motion machine.,22,2
Mikage,People should be humbly giving thanks for these God-given things.,22,2
Tokiko,"Yes, but you could... ",22,2
Tokiko,Excuse me for a moment. ,22,2
Tokiko,Mamiya! What are you doing? ,22,2
Tokiko,Weren't you told to stay in bed today? ,22,2
Mamiya,"Yes, but I got a bit worried about the roses.",22,2
Tokiko,Get back in bed right now! ,22,2
Mamiya,"Okay, in a moment. ",22,2
Tokiko,What I hate the most is someone who doesn't look after themself.,22,2
Tokiko,Sorry you had to see that. ,22,2
Tokiko,Hurry up and go to bed. ,22,2
Mamiya,"You're Professor Nemuro, aren't you? ",22,2
Mikage,And you are? ,22,2
Mamiya,"Chida Tokiko's brother, Mamiya. ",22,2
Mamiya,I've really wanted to meet you for the longest time.,22,2
Mikage,Because of the strange and interesting rumors?,22,2
Mikage,They say I'm a computer-like man. ,22,2
Mamiya,I've read your thesis. ,22,2
Mamiya,"You're the first person I ever respected, except for my sister.",22,2
Mamiya,My sister came to Ohtori Academy to meet you.,22,2
Tokiko,"Because you weren't sleeping quietly, that's why...",22,2
Mamiya,I like it when you give me an injection. ,22,2
Tokiko,"Don't say such stupid things, you brat.",22,2
Tokiko,"It's for his sake, that I'm involved in this.",22,2
Tokiko,The doctors have told me that there's nothing left but to give up hope.,22,2
Tokiko,But if the research succeeds... ,22,2
Mikage,The research has nothing to do with medicine.,22,2
Mikage,"Even if it is a success, it may not help your brother's illness.",22,2
Tokiko,"But, maybe I could grasp eternity for him.",22,2
Tokiko,I'm sorry for crying like this. ,22,2
Mikage,It's all right. It feels like this is the first time I've ever seen a person's tears.,22,2
Tokiko,Is there someone important in your life?,22,2
Tokiko,Or perhaps those people known as geniuses never fall in love with other people?,22,2
Mikage,So it would seem. ,22,2
Mikage,"That is, up until today. ",22,2
boy,"Professor Nemuro is awfully excited about the project recently, isn't he?",22,2
boy,Didn't the Board of Directors send an inspector?,22,2
boy,She really seems to be just right for the job.,22,2
boy,"Well, whatever you-know-who does is never in vain.",22,2
boy,"Then, does the Professor still not know what all this is about?",22,2
Mikage,Shouldn't you be asleep right now? ,22,2
Mamiya,"It's okay, I'm feeling a bit better today.",22,2
Mikage,I see. ,22,2
Mamiya,"The snow in this garden doesn't disappear so easily, does it?",22,2
Mamiya,"My sister was called out by the Board of Directors, so she probably won't be back until evening.",22,2
Mikage,"No, that's fine. ",22,2
Mikage,I only came here today to see your face.,22,2
Mamiya,"So, do you like it? ",22,2
Mamiya,It's a rose sugar-pickle. My sister makes them.,22,2
Mamiya,"These dry flowers are like them, too. ",22,2
Mamiya,"She doesn't want to see the flowers scatter, you see.",22,2
Mamiya,"When she does this, even the shortlived flowers can be made to last a little longer.",22,2
Mamiya,"But, I wonder if the flowers themselves are happy, being forced to last so long.",22,2
Mamiya,"Eternity doesn't exist in this world, does it?",22,2
Mamiya,It's just that one could think that a heart that longs for eternity is beautiful.,22,2
Mikage,You don't think that what your sister and I are doing is going to succeed?,22,2
Mamiya,"I respect the two of you, and I'm grateful as well.",22,2
Mikage,Thank you for having me. I'll be back again sometime.,22,2
Mamiya,Professor Nemuro... ,22,2
Mikage,Yes? ,22,2
Mamiya,I'll be sure to tell my sister that you're worried about me.,22,2
Akio,You still can't solve that equation? ,22,2
Mikage,This place is off-limits to outsiders. ,22,2
Akio,There are no outsiders here. ,22,2
Akio,"Except for you, that is. ",22,2
Akio,That is the first step toward the power to revolutionize the world.,22,2
Akio,That will set everything in motion. ,22,2
Mikage,Ridiculous... How could anyone even execute such a plan?!,22,2
Mikage,"That's the ring everyone wears, isn't it?",22,2
Akio,"It's the Rose Signet, the proof of a contract with me.",22,2
Mikage,Contract? ,22,2
Akio,Yes. ,22,2
Akio,All of the one hundred youths working here are contracted to me.,22,2
Mikage,That's crazy. What is this contract? ,22,2
Mikage,"And these boys bound by that contract, why are you subjecting them to this?",22,2
Mikage,"Besides, even if I do grasp eternity by doing this, she won't be very happy.",22,2
Akio,"Ah, yes, her... ",22,2
Akio,"I'll leave this Rose Signet for you. Should you ever desire eternity, then put it on.",22,2
Akio,I suppose you have no choice but to revolutionize the world.,22,2
Akio,The way before you has been prepared. ,22,2
Tokiko,Is it true? Did you do this? ,22,2
Tokiko,Is this... Is this your doing? ,22,2
Mamiya,Yes. ,22,2
Tokiko,Why? ,22,2
Tokiko,How could you do such a thing? ,22,2
Mikage,Those boys had a contract. ,22,2
Mikage,"Ancient creatures died and left naught but fossil fuels, like coal and petroleum.",22,2
Mikage,"Without that sacrifice, our present energy civilization would not exist.",22,2
Mikage,That sort of sacrifice is what is always demanded.,22,2
Tokiko,What are you talking about? ,22,2
Mikage,This is the first step in the job you are advancing.,22,2
Mikage,"Soon, the road leading to eternity from this Academy will be opened.",22,2

Shadow,A robot does not worry. ,22,2

Shadow,A robot is not lonely. ,22,2

Tokiko,But those who look at you get lonely. ,22,2
Shadow,A monkey! A monkey! ,22,2

Tokiko,"He hasn't aged a bit since then, just like you, hmm?",22,2

Utena,"Oh, Mikage-sempai. ",23,2
Mikage,"The modest scent from a single rose isn't bad,",23,2

secretary,I wonder how I looked from your point of view.,23,2

boy,We can just leave him by the wayside. ,23,2
boy,"Well then, let's open the champagne. ",23,2
Mamiya,How selfish they are. ,23,2
Mamiya,"They owe it to you that the castle appeared and the road to the arena opened, right?",23,2
Mamiya,They're all afraid of you. ,23,2
Mamiya,They think you may be capable of obtaining eternity.,23,2
Nemuro,I'm not going to do anything like dueling. ,23,2
Mamiya,Why not? Aren't you thinking you want the power to revolutionize the world for your very own?,23,2
Mamiya,Knowing eternity exists in that castle? ,23,2
Mamiya,"Eternity means lasting forever, right? ",23,2
Mamiya,"For years, decades, centuries, millennia, eons, and on and on.",23,2
Mamiya,"My life may be just a moment, but... ",23,2
Mamiya,"Eternity means that this moment lasts billions of billions of years, without end.",23,2
Mamiya,I... I... ,23,2
Mamiya,I want eternity. ,23,2
Tokiko,What are you talking about? ,23,2
Nemuro,This is the first step of the job you're advancing.,23,2
Nemuro,"Soon, the road leading to eternity from this Academy will be opened.",23,2

Mikage,You're finally back. ,23,2
Mikage,I knew you'd come back to me sooner or later.,23,2
Mikage,"Tokiko-san, you don't have to regret the fact that you deserted me.",23,2
Utena,"Mikage-sempai, you... ",23,2
Utena,"Mikage-sempai, are you the one who manipulated them?",23,2
Mikage,Manipulated them? Surely not. ,23,2
Mikage,All of these people were members of the Mikage Seminar.,23,2
Mikage,They all had their unforgettable memories. ,23,2
Mikage,"Precious, precious memories... ",23,2
Mikage,They proceeded to fight to protect their memories.,23,2
Mikage,"They are, in a manner of speaking, people who tried to change their lives according to their memories.",23,2
Utena,Memories? ,23,2
Mikage,What about you? ,23,2
Utena,"We can meet again, can't we? ",23,2
Utena,"Prince, we can meet again, can't we? ",23,2
Utena,"Until then, I won't cry, and I'll be patient no matter what.",23,2
Mikage,"For you, it's possible to make the memory last forever, just like I did.",23,2
Mikage,That's what the world needs. ,23,2
Mikage,The path before you has be- ,23,2
Utena,You bastard!! ,23,2
Utena,Who the hell is this World?! ,23,2
Utena,"Don't lump me together with the likes of you, you manipulative...",23,2
Mikage,Don't get so excited. ,23,2
Mikage,"You sound like you're yelling out, ""Don't touch my precious memory!""",23,2
Utena,What did you say?! ,23,2
Utena,Don't even talk like you understand me! ,23,2
Utena,My memory is... ,23,2
Mikage,I see. It's that memory that's been supporting you up until now.,23,2
Mikage,No need to be ashamed. ,23,2
Mikage,Because the memory you possess is a worthy one.,23,2
Mikage,"Only those with beautiful memories are allowed to wish,",23,2
Mikage,"""If only those days could last forever, if only I could still be what I was back then.""",23,2
Mikage,I know that you're the same as myself. ,23,2
Mikage,Your eyes are like those people who can't help wanting to make memories last forever.,23,2
Utena,I challenge you to a duel! Come to the Duel Arena tonight!,23,2
Utena,I'll beat you to a pulp and prove that I'm different from you!,23,2
Mamiya,"Sempai, why did you call her? ",23,2
Mamiya,Why are you keeping quiet? ,23,2
Mamiya,What's so funny? ,23,2
Mikage,"Hey, look. ",23,2
Mikage,It's a tear. ,23,2
Mamiya,A tear? ,23,2
Mikage,It seems the pain made an inadvertent tear come forth.,23,2
Mikage,"If she hadn't found my Rose Signet, ",23,2
Mikage,...I could have been killed right then and there.,23,2
Mamiya,You sound like you're having fun. ,23,2
Mikage,"Indeed, she hurts me and surprises me all the time.",23,2
Mikage,"Just as I thought, Tokiko has returned, to settle the score with me once and for all.",23,2
Mamiya,Do you intend to accept the duel? ,23,2
Mikage,"In the final analysis, we haven't advanced at all since then.",23,2
Mikage,"But, she's closer to the Power of Dios than we are.",23,2
Mikage,We can't proceed without defeating her. ,23,2
Mikage,"Rose blooming at the Ends of the World, to me!",23,2
Mikage,Your eyes are just like those of those people who can't stop wanting to make memories last forever.,23,2
Wakaba,Uuuteeenaaa! ,23,2
Wakaba,"Hey, you haven't forgotten your ultra-best friend Wakaba-sama lately, have you?",23,2

Mikage,Here we go. ,23,2
Mikage,Well received. ,23,2
Mikage,However... ,23,2
Mikage,I'm not in full form yet. The shoulder you screwed up is still aching.,23,2
Mikage,But I don't think I'm going to lose to you!,23,2
Utena,Quit joking around! You think I'm going to be beaten by some string-pulling bastard from the shadows?,23,2
Mikage,That's not how it happened. ,23,2
Mikage,Those who received my black roses came to my place of their own free will.,23,2
Mikage,"Then, they stood in this place of their own free will.",23,2
Mikage,Anyone who stands here is the same as myself. They come lured by eternity.,23,2
Utena,Shut up! Don't accuse other people of what you did for yourself!,23,2
Mikage,I knew since the first time I saw you. ,23,2
Mikage,"You met the person important to you long ago, right?",23,2
Mikage,"And so, that person changed your life forever, right?",23,2
Mikage,You're standing here on the strength of that illusion.,23,2
Mikage,That's why you were able to enter the Duel Arena.,23,2
Mikage,Am I wrong? ,23,2
Mikage,"After all, you're just like me. ",23,2
Mikage,"And right here, right here I will defeat you, Tokiko!",23,2
Utena,What nonsense are you talking about? I won't lose to a bastard like you!,23,2
Mikage,"You're such a stubborn girl, Tokiko. ",23,2
Mikage,Seems you won't get it unless I destroy that rose.,23,2

Mikage,"Where are you, Mamiya? Mamiya! ",23,2
Mikage,Mamiya! ,23,2
Mikage,Who... ,23,2
Mikage,Who is this? ,23,2
Mamiya,You can't defeat her. ,23,2
Mamiya,"You'll never defeat the sister of mine within your memory, not for all eternity.",23,2
Mikage,Tokiko! ,23,2
Mikage,Eternity is right here before my eyes! ,23,2
Mikage,I'll defeat you and grasp the power to change the world with these very hands!,23,2
Mikage,Why don't you understand me?! ,23,2
Mikage,I accept everything! ,23,2
Mikage,Even your brother's sin! ,23,2
Mamiya,"Sempai, now watch carefully. ",23,2
Mamiya,"At that time, at that place, who was actually there and who was not?",23,2
Mamiya,Who actually set fire to that building? ,23,2
Mikage,Mamiya... ,23,2
Mikage,It's been a long time. ,23,2
Mikage,How many decades has it been since I saw you last?,23,2

Akio,"Yes. The boy called Mamiya that you were keeping with you from your lingering attachment to Tokiko, dieda long time ago.",23,2
Akio,I exploited the illusion you cherished in your memory so much that you even halted your own time.,23,2

Utena,Really? So there really was that kind of trouble.,23,2
Miki,"It seems there weren't any casualties, but since it was before the time of the Student Council, no recordsremain.",23,2
Miki,Let's see... What was the building called? Kushiro Memorial Hall...,23,2
Miki,Sounds wrong. Noboribetsu Memorial Hall? Argh! I hate it when I can't remember!,23,2
Utena,Himemiya! Where did you go? ,23,2

Tsuwabuki,"Before you go to the Music room, take a look inside your locker.",24,2
Tsuwabuki,"6th period English, there's a vocabulary test, so here's your cribsheet.",24,2
Nanami,I see. ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,I'll inform you of your afterschool plans at lunchtime. After that-,24,2
Nanami,Tsuwabuki... ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,"Yes, ma'am? ",24,2
Nanami,Thank you. ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,Certainly! ,24,2
Boy,A runaway horse! ,24,2
Boy,A horse is on the loose! ,24,2

Tsuwabuki,My name is Tsuwabuki Mitsuru. ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,I am a student who has dedicated all of myself to Nanami-san.,24,2
Tsuwabuki,"And so, I have a secret that absolutely no one must know!",24,2
text,Nanami-sama Secret Diary ,24,2
Utena,Tsuwabuki-kun's been hurt? ,24,2
Nanami,"Yes, while protecting me. ",24,2
Anthy,Did he die? ,24,2
Nanami,Of course not! ,24,2
Nanami,"The wound itself looks like little more than a bruise and a broken nail,",24,2
Nanami,...but he's still unconscious. ,24,2
Nanami,"Right now, I'm having them arrange a hospital for him.",24,2
Anthy,Hmm? What's this? ,24,2
Utena,A schedule book? ,24,2
Nanami,"Oh, that's Tsuwabuki's. ",24,2
Utena,So he's got names and addresses and stuff written in here?,24,2
Anthy,It has diary-type things written in it.,24,2
Nanami,What? Read it! ,24,2
Anthy,"""My name is Tsuwabuki Mitsuru."" ",24,2
Anthy,"""I am a student who has dedicated all of myself to Nanami-san.""",24,2
Tsuwabuki,I have always had my eye on Nanami-san. ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,...and only Nanami-san. ,24,2
Keiko,It's your fault! ,24,2
Keiko,You snared our Saionji-san and turned him into a loser!,24,2
Yuuko,"He's been away from the Kendo Club, too! ",24,2
Aiko,What a dreadful girl! ,24,2
Keiko,Give us back our Saionji-san! ,24,2
Aiko,Say something! ,24,2
Nanami,Whatever is going on here? ,24,2
Keiko,Nanami-sama... ,24,2
Nanami,"Pray tell, what is all this commotion? ",24,2
Nanami,"Given the circumstances, I'll have to report this to the Student Council.",24,2
Keiko,"Well, uh... ",24,2
Aiko,It's not what it seems. ,24,2
KYA,Excuse us! ,24,2
Nanami,Are you alright? ,24,2
Anthy,"Yes, thank you. ",24,2
Anthy,"You're... Nanami-san, they said it was?",24,2
Nanami,"Since you're so popular among the boys, ",24,2
Nanami,...you tend to make them jealous. ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,Nanami-san is incredible. ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,"With purity, nobility and great beauty, ",24,2
Tsuwabuki,"...protecting the weak, detesting all evil, entirely for justice in the Academy.",24,2
Tsuwabuki,"But, I know... ",24,2
Tsuwabuki,I know Nanami-san's naked face. ,24,2
Utena,Nanami's naked face? ,24,2
Nanami,What's with those looks? ,24,2
Utena,"Looks like he knows you through and through, from shiny surface to filthy underbelly.",24,2
Nanami,What do you mean by filthy underbelly? ,24,2
Keiko,"Nanami-sama, she's come wearing the dress we sent her.",24,2
Aiko,It really suits her. ,24,2
Boy,"Oh, I apologize, Miss! ",24,2
Anthy,It's all right. ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,"Never dirtying her own hands, ",24,2
Tsuwabuki,"...her stoic manner in which she merely watches the suffering from a safe distance,",24,2
Tsuwabuki,...certainly is the proper form for she who rules the Academy from the shadows.,24,2
Utena,"Yeah, something like that happened. ",24,2
Anthy,"So that was Nanami-san's doing, wasn't it?",24,2
Nanami,Th- that's all Tsuwabuki's delusions! ,24,2
Nanami,It's unimaginable that I would do something so wild.,24,2
Nanami,"Tsuwabuki sure is a weird kid, huh? ",24,2
Tsuwabuki,Nanami-san's malice didn't end at that level.,24,2
Tsuwabuki,As in this case... ,24,2
Keiko,Nanami-sama... ,24,2
Keiko,"8th Grade, Class A, has started cooking practice, as scheduled.",24,2
Nanami,So it appears. ,24,2
Nanami,And what we were discussing earlier? ,24,2
Keiko,"Yes, ma'am, I just made the substitution. ",24,2
Keiko,"100X curry, an Indian specialty hot enough to make you breathe fire.",24,2
Nanami,Excellent. ,24,2
Nanami,"Watch out, Tenjou Utena and Himemiya Anthy.",24,2
Nanami,I'll soon have you begging for mercy. ,24,2
SYT,Curry... ,24,2
SYT,curry... ,24,2
SYT,curry... ,24,2
SYT,CURRY!! ,24,2
Anthy,It's ready! ,24,2
Keiko,Nanami-sama! ,24,2
Nanami,"Be quiet, it's getting good now. ",24,2
Keiko,"I'm sorry, but, um.. ",24,2
Nanami,But what? ,24,2
Aiko,The substitution wasn't for 100X curry... ,24,2
Keiko,"It appears to be for super spicy 900 Billion X curry,",24,2
Keiko,...so hot it'll blast you to smithereens and make phantom elephants trumpet loudly.,24,2
Nanami,Phantom... smithereens? ,24,2
Nanami,No way... ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,Tenjou-san and Himemiya-san... ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,"That's right, their personalities were exchanged by Nanami-san's curry.",24,2
Anthy,"Utena-sama, that's wonderful! ",24,2
Utena,"Well, it feels weird being praised by my own body.",24,2
Anthy,"You see, I'm not very good at sports, ",24,2
Anthy,...so seeing my own body acting so wonderfully makes me happy.,24,2
Utena,"But, we gotta think of a way to return to normal.",24,2
Anthy,Don't worry! ,24,2
Anthy,I'm sure even now Nanami-sama is... ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,"Right. Nanami-san put forth her best efforts,",24,2
Tsuwabuki,...to atone for her sin without losing her cheerful smile.,24,2
Keiko,Nanami-sama! ,24,2
Nanami,An elephant?! ,24,2
Keiko,Nanami-sama! ,24,2
Nanami,Not again! ,24,2
Aiko,Nanami-sama! ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,Here's a souvenir. ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,"Then, Nanami-san came back, stronger than ever.",24,2
Touga,Nanami! ,24,2
Nanami,Onii-sama!! ,24,2
Touga,Nanami! The replacement? ,24,2
Nanami,That was the last one. ,24,2
Nanami,They said it will take another 200 years to refine it to 900 Billion X spice.,24,2
Aiko,200 years? ,24,2
Keiko,200 years? ,24,2
Yuuko,200 years? ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,200 years? ,24,2
Touga,200 years? ,24,2
Anthy,200 years? ,24,2
Utena,200 years? ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,"Surely, I thought it looked like karmic retribution.",24,2
Anthy,"Now that you mention it, that was the case.",24,2
Utena,"Nanami is just thoroughly evil, isn't she?",24,2
Nanami,What are you talking about?! ,24,2
Nanami,"It wasn't the curry I substituted that switched your personalities,",24,2
Nanami,"...it was purely because of your cooking skills, am I not right?",24,2
Anthy,Was it? ,24,2
Nanami,You... ,24,2
Utena,"So what other evil deeds are written after that, I wonder?",24,2
Nanami,"Wait a second, aside from that, ",24,2
Nanami,...is there anything about Tsuwabuki in there?,24,2
Anthy,There's nothing written but stuff about Nanami-san.,24,2
Tsuwabuki,Nanami-san seems to have been treating Himemiya-san badly for any reason at all.,24,2
Tsuwabuki,As in this case... ,24,2
Miki,"Huh, they say this dorm is haunted, but it's actually quite nice inside.",24,2
Nanami,You have such a nice room. ,24,2
Utena,"Yeah, Himemiya cleans up religiously everyday.",24,2
Miki,"Himemiya-san must really like to keep things neat, then.",24,2
Nanami,"Wow, I'm really impressed. ",24,2
Nanami,"Ok, just watch. ",24,2
Nanami,Think Himemiya Anthy's a cute girl while you can...,24,2
Miki,"I envy you, Tenjou-sempai, living with such a feminine girl.",24,2
Utena,Is that sarcasm? ,24,2
Nanami,"Himemiya-sempai, may I borrow your eraser? ",24,2
Nanami,It's a snail! ,24,2
Nanami,It's a snake! ,24,2
Nanami,There's an octopus in here! ,24,2
Nanami,Himemiya's true character has been exposed! ,24,2
Nanami,That's what's going to happen! ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,"However, Nanami-san also had a tough time.",24,2
Tsuwabuki,"Sometimes, the wounding party gets hurt instead of the intended target.",24,2
Nanami,"Himemiya-sempai, may I borrow your eraser? ",24,2
Nanami,"Himemiya Anthy, prepare yourself! ",24,2
Utena,I wouldn't open that if I were you. ,24,2
Nanami,"This can't be true, it must be a dream. ",24,2
Nanami,This huge octupus and its octupus tentacles... ,24,2
Utena,"You really are evil, aren't you? ",24,2
Nanami,Evil? Moi? ,24,2
Nanami,You have got to be kidding me! ,24,2
Nanami,"That time, it was me that was the victim, wasn't it?",24,2
Anthy,"""And so, Nanami-san has been hostile toward Himemiya-san, but...""",24,2
Nanami,"St- st- st- st- st- stop that, I wasn't hostile or anything.",24,2
Utena,You don't have to play dumb anymore. ,24,2
Anthy,"""...there's a reason for that. A profound reason, which must not be uttered to another soul...""",24,2
Utena,Reason? ,24,2
Utena,Oh. ,24,2
Nanami,"Hey, stop already! And give that back! ",24,2
Utena,Thought this wasn't yours? ,24,2
Anthy,"You're going to tear that apart, you know!",24,2
Nanami,"You inhuman, demon, villain! ",24,2
Utena,That's you! ,24,2
Nanami,What is it? ,24,2
Utena,Can you hear it? ,24,2
Nanami,What? ,24,2
Anthy,That slight tooth-grinding. ,24,2
Anthy,Like a rope bridge swaying in the wind.,24,2
Nanami,"No, it's the sound of a seaside swingset squeaking.",24,2
Anthy,"He who once ruled the Student Council, Touga-sempai.",24,2
Nanami,Guess who! ,24,2
Touga,"Stop it, Nanami. ",24,2
Nanami,"It's such a lovely evening, isn't it? Onii-sama...",24,2
Touga,"You're such a baby, little sister. ",24,2
Tsuwabuki,"For Nanami-san, Touga-sempai is her entire world.",24,2
Nanami,You two!! ,24,2
Utena,"""Only Touga-sempai could be the one and only man to live up to Nanami-san's ideals.""",24,2
Tsuwabuki,"Even though I'm still inexperienced, someday I want to be a big brother like Touga-sempai.",24,2
Utena,"C'mon, let's stop. ",24,2
Anthy,Oh? ,24,2
Utena,It's not right. All his thoughts are packed in this book.,24,2
Utena,"And here we are, peeking at it... ",24,2
Nanami,"You've read almost everything, so who cares about the weight of Tsuwabuki-kun's feelings?",24,2
Nanami,How about the weight of my feelings? ,24,2
Utena,About 49 kilos? ,24,2
Nanami,I've gained?! ,24,2
Anthy,"Oh, I wonder what's on this page. ",24,2
Anthy,Operation the First... ,24,2
Nanami,"Did you say ""operation?"" ",24,2
Nanami,Where am I? ,24,2
Nanami,Who am I? ,24,2
Nanami,It's no use. I can't remember anything. ,24,2
Touga,Nanami... ,24,2
Nanami,Who's there? ,24,2
Touga,Have you forgotten? ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,"It's me, your older brother. ",24,2
Nanami,Onii-sama?! ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,"Come here, Nanami! ",24,2
Nanami,ONII-SAMA!! ,24,2
Nanami,"Wait, what is this? ",24,2
Utena,Beats me. ,24,2
Anthy,Operation the Second... ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,"Arrrrggh, wait a minute! ",24,2
Nanami,Tsuwabuki... ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,"Please, don't read any further! ",24,2
Nanami,Now what are you talking about? ,24,2
Nanami,All your plots will be thoroughly exposed! ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,"What do you mean, plots? ",24,2
Tsuwabuki,"All I wanted was to become the kind of man that suits you, Nanami-san.",24,2
Nanami,Why you little...! ,24,2
Utena,"Nanami, calm down! If you get too excited, you'll turn into a cow again!",24,2
Anthy,"Operation the Second... When Nanami-san becomes a cow again,",24,2
Anthy,"And this time, I think I can cope with that this way.",24,2
Utena,Nanami! ,24,2
Utena,Get rid of that cowbell! ,24,2
Utena,Get rid of it! ,24,2
Nanami,"Shut up already, moo. ",24,2
Utena,Do you even know what the bell on your neck is supposed to be?,24,2
Nanami,"Really, moo! It's a Sebastian Dior cowbell, right? Really, moo!",24,2
Utena,A cowbell is just a bell they hang on a cow's neck.,24,2
Nanami,What are you talking about? Moo. ,24,2
Utena,Look around you! ,24,2
Nanami,"So, so, Sebastian Dior, the purveyor to the Court is...",24,2
Utena,"It's not Sebastian Dior, but Koushi-chan Dior! (koushi = calf)",24,2
Nanami,Ko- Koushi-chan? ,24,2
Utena,"You didn't even know what a cowbell is all about,",24,2
Utena,"...and you were all proud of that humongous bell, wearing it on your neck.",24,2
Utena,What you're doing now is exactly what a cow does!,24,2
Nanami,Cow? ,24,2
Utena,We can't do anything about that now. ,24,2
Utena,What you can do now is throw that bell away before you completely turn into a cow.,24,2
Nanami,Wh- What are you talking about? Moo. ,24,2
Nanami,How could I possibly become a cow? Moo. ,24,2
Nanami,"Really now, don't surprise me. Moo. Quit kidding around, already. Moo.",24,2
Anthy,"Utena-sama, it's finally finished! ",24,2
Utena,What's this? ,24,2
Anthy,It's a sweater. ,24,2
Utena,"Thanks, but it's a bit out of season, isn't it?",24,2
Nanami,"Moo. If it had gone a little more, moo, I would have attracted intense attention.",24,2
Nanami,"Somehow, my mind is getting, moo, fuzzy... ",24,2
Nanami,"Could it be a delusion, moo? My appendix, moo?",24,2
Nanami,"Or I might have been bitten by a, moo, virulent poisonous snake...",24,2
Nanami,"Somebody, moo, get me a blanket! ",24,2
Utena,Nanami... ,24,2
Utena,"Nanami, you look... ",24,2
Anthy,I'm scared! ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,Nanami-san! ,24,2
Anthy,She's coming right for us! ,24,2
Utena,"Oh, I get it! She got all excited when she saw this red sweater!",24,2
Anthy,"Oh, my! ",24,2
Utena,"Himemiya, get away! ",24,2
Anthy,All right! ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,It's all right now. ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,"It's all right now, Nanami-san. ",24,2
Tsuwabuki,"I'll take care of you, even if you do become a cow.",24,2
Tsuwabuki,"I'll stay with you, Nanami-san. ",24,2
Tsuwabuki,"Stop it, stop it, please! ",24,2
Nanami,"Don't be such a poor sport, Tsuwabuki! ",24,2
Tsuwabuki,Don't look! ,24,2
Nanami,Where am I? ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,"Ah, you're conscious... How do you feel?",24,2
Nanami,What do you have written there? ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,"You fell behind schedule, didn't you?",24,2
Tsuwabuki,I've been rescheduling. ,24,2
Nanami,"Really, how goes it? I want to see. ",24,2
Tsuwabuki,I'll tell you about it later. ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,No need to worry. ,24,2
Nanami,I've got it now! ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,"Oh, crap! ",24,2
Nanami,"So it seems there are nasty things written in here, eh?",24,2
Nanami,Seize him! ,24,2
Tsuwabuki,St- St- St- St- St- Stop!! Let me go! Let me goooo!,24,2

Wakaba,All right! ,25,3
Akio,"Since we don't have any other family, I want to be near my sister, of course.",25,3

Akio,"All right, look at the tip of my hand. ",25,3
Akio,That star conspicuously sparkling up there is Venus.,25,3
Utena,Ah... ,25,3
Akio,The Morning Star... ,25,3
Akio,"My name, Akio, was derived from the name of this star.",25,3
Utena,"Wow, that sounds kind of romantic. ",25,3
Akio,"The Morning Star, ",25,3
Akio,...also known as Lucifer. ,25,3
Utena,Lucifer? ,25,3
Akio,"The star that was originally an angel, but chose to become the Devil.",25,3
Akio,"If you look up from this earth, it's always by the Sun.",25,3
Akio,"And unless the Sun sinks, it can never shine.",25,3
Akio,And what do you suppose it thinks when it does shine?,25,3
Utena,Himemiya... ,25,3
Anthy,"I just heard that dinner is ready, Utena-sama. ",25,3
Utena,R- Really? I'm starving. ,25,3
Utena,"Well then, Akio-san, if you'll excuse me...",25,3
Utena,"Akio-san is a nice person, isn't he? ",25,3
Anthy,Yes. ,25,3
Utena,But... ,25,3
Anthy,But? ,25,3
Utena,"Whenever he's talking about stars, his eyes look lonely.",25,3
Utena,Like someone who lost something important... ,25,3
Utena,"Still, somehow he gives me the feeling that I've known him before.",25,3
Anthy,"There are times when I feel I've known you before too, Utena-sama.",25,3
Utena,Me? ,25,3
Anthy,Yes. ,25,3
Utena,It's unusual for you to say something like that.,25,3
Anthy,I'm sorry. ,25,3
Utena,"No, I'm glad. ",25,3
Utena,"Hey, if something ever troubles you, come talk to me about it first.",25,3
Utena,"No matter what, we'll help each other. ",25,3
Utena,That's the kind of friends I want us to be.,25,3
Anthy,"I understand. From now on, you and I will help each other to go on living.",25,3
Anthy,Utena-sama... ,25,3
Anthy,"Actually, I... ",25,3
Utena,What? ,25,3
Anthy,Nothing. ,25,3
Touga,Scrubbing the floor this late in the night?,25,3
Touga,You remain as upright as ever. ,25,3
Touga,You'll be the champion of the local tournament this year again.,25,3
Saionji,One of the reasons that I hate you is the way you're conceited now.,25,3
Touga,Oh? ,25,3
Saionji,You are right. I will be the champion again this year.,25,3
Saionji,But you think that that's meaningless child's play... and you're laughing in your heart.,25,3
Touga,That's not true. ,25,3
Saionji,"After all, in this world, battles are only won by the strong.",25,3
Saionji,"Even if you're conceited with your cheap tricks, don't forget that you lost to Tenjou Utena as well.",25,3
Touga,As have you. ,25,3
Touga,"Furthermore, I hear that someone I know said he's quitting the duels now.",25,3
Touga,"However, I have not yet given up. ",25,3
Touga,There's someone I want you to meet. ,25,3
Touga,Someone you want me to meet? ,25,3
Touga,"You haven't really given up either, have you?",25,3
Touga,"Listen, can't you hear it? ",25,3
Saionji,Hear what? ,25,3
Touga,"So long as your soul hasn't given up entirely,",25,3
Touga,"...then you should be able to hear this sound,",25,3
Touga,...running about the ends of the world. ,25,3
Saionji,What nonsense... ,25,3
Saionji,What the... What is this?! ,25,3
Touga,"Then come, journey with us, to the world which you desire!",25,3
Saionji,"So, you're the Trustee Board Chairman who's engaged to Ohtori's daughter.",25,3
Touga,"Yes, and Himemiya Anthy's older brother. ",25,3
Touga,Do you want the Rose Bride? ,25,3
Saionji,What do you mean? ,25,3
Touga,Exactly what I said. ,25,3
Touga,What do you want? What are you aiming for? What do you want to be?,25,3
Saionji,What's the point in asking things like that?,25,3
Saionji,"First of all, I have no trust in the likes of you.",25,3
Touga,"Come on, aren't you my one and only friend? ",25,3
Saionji,There's no such thing as friendship in this world.,25,3
Touga,Is that so? ,25,3
Saionji,That is so. ,25,3
Touga,I wonder... ,25,3
Touga,I wonder if you really believe that. ,25,3
Saionji,What are you getting at? ,25,3
Touga,"Well then, why are you striving for that castle said to hold eternity?",25,3
Touga,"Isn't that because you believe that if you get there, you will find something eternal,",25,3
Touga,"...for example, eternal friendship or something?",25,3
Touga,Do you remember that girl who was in the coffin a long time ago?,25,3
Saionji,"Something like that happened, I suppose. ",25,3
Touga,"There was a girl who was saying she wanted to see eternity, right?",25,3
Saionji,I'm not sure. I barely remember it. ,25,3
Touga,The one who saved that girl from the coffin that night was Akio-san here.,25,3
Saionji,What? ,25,3
Touga,She was saved because Akio-san showed her something eternal.,25,3
Saionji,Say what?! Who the hell are you? ,25,3
Akio,"She's purring nicely, don't you think? ",25,3
Saionji,What are you talking about? ,25,3
Akio,"The ends of the world, I will show... to you.",25,3
Saionji,You couldn't be... ,25,3
Utena,How should I know when I don't receive any letters from the Ends of the World?,25,3
Miki,"So you don't know, then. ",25,3
Utena,"So, what were you saying about the stairway to the Duel Arena?",25,3
Miki,You know how the stairway spirals around the central pillar?,25,3
Utena,Yeah. ,25,3
Miki,There's something like a gondola inside the column.,25,3
Utena,Gondola? ,25,3
Saionji,That's right. ,25,3
Saionji,That gondola is the set of wings that fly toward the ends of the world.,25,3
Saionji,And it will carry me and the Rose Bride to the castle said to hold eternity.,25,3
Utena,Saionji... ,25,3
Miki,"You no longer duel, do you? ",25,3
Saionji,"Unfortunately, I am not the same man I was yesterday.",25,3
Miki,What are you saying is different about you?,25,3
Saionji,Can't you see? ,25,3
Miki,No. ,25,3
Utena,I have no idea what you're talking about. ,25,3
Saionji,"I see, so you don't know. ",25,3
Saionji,Not that you would understand even if I told you...,25,3
Miki,What do you intend to do? ,25,3
Utena,Micky! ,25,3
Utena,Are you all right? ,25,3
Saionji,The Rose Bride belongs to me. ,25,3
Utena,"Let go of Himemiya, Saionji! ",25,3
Shadow,"I wonder, I wonder... Do you know what I wonder?",25,3
Shadow,I hear there's going to be another duel out back in the forest today!,25,3
Shadow,It's been quite a while since this phrase was last used.,25,3
Shadow,"Of course, it's better done by two people... ",25,3
Shadow,...than by one! ,25,3
Shadow,"Half the suffering, ",25,3
Shadow,...double the happiness! ,25,3
Shadow,"Hey, wait! You used my shampoo without permission last night!",25,3
Shadow,"And you, you went and finished off the pudding I was eating.",25,3
Shadow,...though it was from two weeks ago. ,25,3
Shadow,Are you serious? ,25,3
Shadow,"But now, brave warrior, ",25,3
Shadow,I wonder if you really know... ,25,3
Shadow,...the difficulty in getting along together. ,25,3
Shadow,"I wonder, I wonder... ",25,3
Shadow,Do you know what I wonder? ,25,3
Shadow,Ugh... Here it comes. ,25,3

Saionji,Indeed. Long ago I did think about the Rose Bride's feelings.,25,3
Saionji,That's why I got so heated. But now I know.,25,3

Miki,I said don't lean on me. ,26,3
Utena,I left your bags right here. ,26,3
Miki,Sorry for making you carry our luggage around.,26,3
Anthy,What shall we do with these little ones?,26,3
Miki,"Bringing them home with us was all very well and good, but now what?",26,3
Anthy,How about giving them some ground millet for now?,26,3
Miki,Millet? ,26,3
Anthy,...which is also fed to parakeets and Java sparrows.,26,3
Miki,"Oh, that stuff? ",26,3
Anthy,Steep it in tepid water and then grind it.,26,3
Miki,Right. ,26,3
Anthy,"Since they are chicks, you must feed them every three hours during the day.",26,3

Miki,"Himemiya-san, you must've raised chicks before, right?",26,3
Anthy,No. ,26,3
Miki,"Really? You sure know a lot about it. You're really into animals, aren't you?",26,3
Anthy,"Actually, it would be best to return the birds to their parents, but...",26,3
Anthy,"Oh, are you all right standing by yourself? ",26,3
Kozue,"Thank you. But since you've come all this way out here,",26,3
Kozue,the cute younger sister will tactfully bow out.,26,3
Kozue,Take your time. ,26,3
Kozue,"That letter. Is it from ""her""? ",26,3

Miki,You read it too. ,26,3

Anthy,Hmm? Which garden? ,26,3
Utena,"""The Sunlit Garden"". You know, the title of that song Miki wrote.",26,3
Anthy,"I don't know. But that's just an image, right?",26,3
Utena,Didn't Miki say that he and Kozue-chan played piano in a garden when they were little?,26,3
Anthy,So he did. ,26,3
Utena,I wonder if it was this one? It's pretty desolate.,26,3
Anthy,"Well, it's a memory, so... ",26,3
Utena,"That's probably true, but I imagined something more...",26,3
Akio,More...what? What did she say? ,26,3
Anthy,Well now...I wondered that too. ,26,3
Anthy,I haven't a clue. ,26,3
Akio,What do you think of her? ,26,3
Anthy,What do I think...? ,26,3
Akio,What do you think of her. Tell me. ,26,3

Akio,Aren't the three of us just like family already?,26,3
Akio,You don't have to hesitate at all. ,26,3
Utena,Just like family huh? ,26,3
Anthy,I'm sorry. My brother said a rather forward thing to you...,26,3
Utena,"No, it's okay. ",26,3
Utena,"I don't have any family, so it actually made me feel good.",26,3
Utena,"It's true. Your brother's really, like, magnaminous.",26,3
Anthy,"My brother is...well, let's see. He certainly is mature.",26,3
Anthy,He's like a parent to me. ,26,3
Utena,Parents... ,26,3
Utena,Do you think fathers and mothers always care for their children like Miki said?,26,3
Anthy,Could that be because of their genes? ,26,3
Utena,That's a pretty harsh thing to say. ,26,3
Anthy,I'm sorry. ,26,3
Utena,You don't have to apologize. ,26,3
Juri,The Ends of the World started sending us letters again.,26,3
Miki,"Saionji-senpai hated the Duels that much, but he Dueled again anyway.",26,3
Miki,Maybe it's got something to do with that.,26,3
Juri,I'm worried about what Touga's up to. ,26,3
Nanami,What about my brother? ,26,3
Juri,"""Defeat Tenjou Utena, for the sake of you Duelists""...is it?",26,3
Miki,I don't like this! ,26,3
Miki,"Most adults who tell you to do things ""for your own sake"" can't be trusted.",26,3
Nanami,"That's a motion of no-confidence towards the Ends of the World, isn't it?",26,3
Miki,Interpret it that way if you want. ,26,3
Miki,"If Dueling means being manipulated by selfish adults, I'm stopping right now.",26,3
Juri,It's too early to be that resolute. ,26,3
Juri,The true nature of the Ends of the World is not yet known.,26,3
Nanami,"That's right. He might be ""Daddy Long Legs"" for all you know.",26,3
Juri,Nanami. Hurry up and let me use that. ,26,3
Nanami,No-o-o-o-o-o.... ,26,3
Miki,Yeah. It was in the letter from mother. ,26,3
Miki,"No, Kozue and I aren't opposed to it. ",26,3
Miki,"Father, it's entirely up to you. ",26,3
Miki,"I don't think we'll be able to make it to the wedding, but we'll at least send a telegram.",26,3
Miki,What? With who? ,26,3
Miki,"Oh, don't bother. You mean new mother, right?. Don't worry about that.",26,3
Miki,Father? ,26,3
Anthy,Don't worry. Calling myself his mother so suddenly would be too shameless.,26,3
Nanami,"Well, look who's here! ",26,3
Kozue,Same to you. ,26,3
Nanami,What're you doing? I heard you were injured.,26,3
Kozue,Wild animals heal fast. ,26,3
Nanami,"Is that so. Well, that's fine... ",26,3
Nanami,..but loitering is prohibited for anybody not on the Student Council.,26,3
Kozue,I'm meeting someone. ,26,3
Nanami,At this hour? Who on earth? ,26,3
Kozue,"A ""Daddy Long Legs"". Shall I introduce you?",26,3
Nanami,No thanks. ,26,3
Touga,It's almost dawn. How long do you plan on staying here?,26,3
Miki,The school festival is coming up. I'm getting my fingers in shape.,26,3
Touga,What are you being indignant for? ,26,3
Miki,I'm not being indignant or anything... ,26,3
Touga,I hear you plan to quit being a Duelist. ,26,3
Miki,Yes. ,26,3
Touga,But you've already chosen the path of a Duelist.,26,3
Touga,I believe you know that there's something you can't have unless you take it for yourself.,26,3
Touga,Reached an impasse? ,26,3
Miki,Juri-san said she suspected you've been up to something lately.,26,3
Touga,Such a beautiful melody. ,26,3
Touga,But it can't sustain that beauty by being beautiful alone.,26,3
Touga,"Oh my, it hit the wall already. ",26,3
Miki,What are you trying to say? ,26,3
Touga,There's someone I want you to meet. ,26,3
Miki,Someone you want me to meet? ,26,3
Touga,"Listen, can't you hear it? ",26,3
Miki,Hear what? ,26,3
Touga,If your soul has not truly given up... ,26,3
Touga,...you should be able to hear... ,26,3
Touga,...the sound... ,26,3
Touga,...resounding across the Ends of the World.,26,3
Miki,What are you talking about? ,26,3
Miki,I hear it! I really hear it! ,26,3
Miki,What's going on?! ,26,3
Touga,"Now, allow us to invite you, to the world you desire!",26,3
Miki,You're the Chairman of the Board...correct? ,26,3
Kozue,Yep. Himemiya-senpai's older brother. ,26,3
Miki,What're you doing in a place like this? ,26,3
Kozue,It's obvious. I'm on a date with Akio-san. ,26,3
Miki,"Oh? Well, whatever. ",26,3
Miki,"More importantly, what do you want with me, Mr. Chairman?",26,3
Kozue,"You love Himemiya-senpai, don't you Miki?",26,3
Miki,Hey! ,26,3
Kozue,You don't have to be so bashful. ,26,3
Kozue,"If she's so important to you, then make her yours.",26,3
Kozue,Akio-san said he'd help you. ,26,3
Kozue,He's awesome. ,26,3
Miki,I thought you hated Himemiya-senpai. ,26,3
Kozue,What I want is for you to be happy. ,26,3
Miki,"What're you talking about, all of a sudden?",26,3
Kozue,I'm always honest with my feelings. That's all.,26,3
Kozue,I don't lie. ,26,3
Kozue,Don't you trust me? ,26,3
Miki,That's not it... ,26,3
Kozue,Akio-san said it's for your own sake. ,26,3
Miki,"Well, he's an adult. ",26,3
Kozue,So? ,26,3
Kozue,"If everything around you is dirty, don't you have no choice but to get dirty too?",26,3
Kozue,You've got no choice but to get dirty and then get what you want.,26,3
Miki,What I want... ,26,3
Miki,"You're the one who made Saionji-san Duel before, aren't you?",26,3
Miki,"You seduced Touga, and interfered with the Student Council...",26,3
Miki,...what the hell are you...? ,26,3
Akio,"I'll show you the Ends of the World. Yes, even you.",26,3
Miki,So that's it! You're... ,26,3
Kozue,"Hey, be more gentle. ",26,3
Miki,Sorry. Is it crooked? ,26,3
Kozue,"No, it's okay. Attach it here. ",26,3
Miki,Okay. ,26,3
Utena,"Hi, you two. Setting up a nest box? ",26,3
Utena,I wonder if the parent birds will come back.,26,3
Utena,What is it? ,26,3

Nanami,That's not what I meant! ,27,3
Touga,Then what? ,27,3
Nanami,"So, what about girls who lay eggs... ",27,3
Touga,Nanami. Do you know why we're able to live together happily like this?,27,3
Nanami,What? ,27,3

Shadow,Pardon me! Wouldn't it be faster to simply break the bottom?,27,3
Shadow,"No, that is not correct! ",27,3
Shadow,If we support it with chopsticks like so...,27,3
Shadow,I guess it wasn't an egg. ,27,3
Nanami,I'm sorry. I don't have the courage to eat my own egg.,27,3
Nanami,Please live here in happiness. ,27,3
Nanami,It's been a long time since we ate together.,27,3
Nanami,I'm so happy! ,27,3
Touga,Nanami. Do you know why we're able to enjoy times like this together?,27,3
Nanami,What? ,27,3
Touga,It's because you're not the kind of girl who lays eggs.,27,3

Saionji,"Ordinarily, eggs are supposed to be eaten.",27,3
Nanami,"You brute, brute brute brute brute!! ",27,3
Saionji,Hey! Stop that! ,27,3
Nanami,Give back my egg... Give it back! ,27,3
Saionji,"There are limits to gluttony. If you wanted to eat an egg, you should simply have asked.",27,3
Saionji,I've got any number of them right here.,27,3
Nanami,Thank goodness! You're all right! ,27,3
Saionji,But let me caution you: having an acquaintance who makes such a fuss over an egg is embarrassingin the extreme.,27,3
Saionji,Never again display such- ,27,3
Saionji,Neither of those siblings has the slightest shred of grace.,27,3

Utena,Hmmm. I dunno. ,27,3
Anthy,"They say that an elephant, at the end of its lifespan, parts from the herd and dies in solitude.",27,3
Utena,"Maybe it doesn't want to make its children sad, and dies alone so no one can say anything.",27,3
Anthy,From parent to child...hearts being passed on eternally.,27,3
Utena,I see. I guess bequeathing one's heart to one's descendants could be called a form of reincarnation.,27,3

Shadow,I got one! ,28,3
Shadow,Hold on tight! Don't let it get away! ,28,3
Shadow,"Okay, come to papa! ",28,3
Shadow,"Hey, isn't that a sandal? ",28,3
Shadow,"Ooh, I got one over here! ",28,3
Shadow,"Don't lose it, this is for dinner tonight!",28,3
Shadow,"Damn, it's a kettle. ",28,3
Shadow,"Look, they're biting over there too! ",28,3
Shadow,"Okay, this is the real thing this time!",28,3
Shadow,A tire? ,28,3
Shadow,I guess. ,28,3
Shadow,Heave! ,28,3
Ruka,"If you saw my match with Juri, you should already know.",28,3
Ruka,I'm far better with a sword. ,28,3
Utena,We'll never know till we try. ,28,3
Ruka,"That's correct. You've got hidden powers, and I may not be able to beat them.",28,3
Anthy,"O roses of noble memory, I beseech thee:",28,3
Anthy,Appear before me. ,28,3
Anthy,Grant me the power to Revolutionize the World!,28,3
Utena,Grant me the power to Revolutionize the World!,28,3
Ruka,Neither Saionji nor Touga is an amateur. Yet they couldn't beat you.,28,3
Ruka,I wonder how we'll do. ,28,3
Utena,You're the first person who's ever said that during a Duel.,28,3
Ruka,Really? But because I've decided to fight...,28,3
Ruka,...I intend to win! ,28,3
Ruka,Now! Show me your power! ,28,3
Utena,So strong... ,28,3
Ruka,Oh? This might be easier than I thought. ,28,3
Utena,Say what?! ,28,3
Ruka,"Hey now, I'm still recovering. ",28,3
Ruka,Be a bit more gentle. ,28,3
Ruka,What? Is that it? ,28,3
Ruka,"Ah, so that's it. ",28,3
Shiori,"Hey, we'll win next time, right? I mean, the Power of Miracles is ours after all.",28,3
Shiori,Those two won't- ,28,3
Ruka,There is no next time. ,28,3
Shiori,What? ,28,3
Ruka,"No matter how often we do this, the outcome wouldn't change.",28,3
Ruka,It's partially the Bride's fault that I lost.,28,3
Shiori,"No way, that's cruel. ",28,3
Shiori,Do you know how much I cared about you?,28,3
Shiori,That's right! I polished your sword every day!,28,3
Shiori,Only for you... ,28,3
Ruka,Oh that? That wasn't my sword. ,28,3
Ruka,"Your acting was really something. Great, for an ad-lib.",28,3
Juri,I thought I told you to keep your hands off Shiori.,28,3
Ruka,She chose this herself. ,28,3
Juri,Don't say that. ,28,3
Ruka,Right. There's no need for me to say it.,28,3
Ruka,"After all, you know it better than anybody else.",28,3
Juri,Ruka! What're you after! What're you thinking?!,28,3
Juri,Ruka!! ,28,3
Shiori,"Believe in miracles, that your wishes come true...",29,3
Ruka,Oh that? That wasn't my sword. ,29,3
Ruka,"Your acting was really something. Great, for an ad-lib.",29,3
Shiori,Tsuchiya-senpai... ,29,3
Shiori,"Believe in miracles, that your wishes... ",29,3
Shiori,"Senpai, wait! ",29,3
Shiori,"Please, you're the only one for me. ",29,3
Shiori,I have nobody but you. ,29,3
Ruka,Would you let go of my hand? ,29,3
Shiori,"If I lose you, I don't know how I can go on.",29,3
Shiori,"So please, believe! ",29,3
Ruka,Believe in what? ,29,3
Shiori,In what...? ,29,3
Ruka,What am I supposed to believe about you?,29,3
Shiori,"Senpai, to me you're more than anyone...more than...",29,3
Shiori,Senpai! Senpai!! ,29,3
title,Azure Blue Paler Than the Sky ,29,3
girl,She's still gone from class today. ,29,3
girl,Damn straight! ,29,3
girl,"Right, there's no way she can face the others.",29,3
girl,It's the talk of the whole school. ,29,3
girl,Of course it is. ,29,3
girl,"But you know, wasn't that kind of cold of Ruka-senpai?",29,3
girl,Really? Looks to me like that girl was the only one getting worked up.,29,3
girl,"Yeah, that's true. ",29,3
girls,"Yeah, no doubt. ",29,3
girl,"Well, isn't it like both their faults? ",29,3
girl,Yeah. ,29,3
girl,"Oh, what a mess. ",29,3
Juri,Don't forget the trick I just showed you.,29,3
girl,Yes ma'am! Thank you very much! ,29,3
Juri,Meddling again? That's a bad habit of yours.,29,3
Utena,Senpai! Aren't you worried? ,29,3
Utena,Shiori-san's in so much pain... ,29,3
Juri,It's a problem between the two of them. None of my business.,29,3
Juri,"It's none of my business, and I have no intention of sticking my nose in it.",29,3
Juri,I don't deserve to. ,29,3
Utena,You don't have to put it that way! How can you do nothing when a friend is hurting like that?,29,3
Utena,Can't you at least listen to what she has to say? Senpai!,29,3
Juri,"Don't make me repeat myself, understand? ",29,3
Utena,Arisugawa-senpai looked like she was stressing herself out.,29,3
Utena,I just can't understand how she could say it's none of her business when Shiori-san was in trouble likethat.,29,3
Utena,I wonder if that's how senpai really feels.,29,3
Anthy,That could be part of how Juri-san really feels.,29,3
Utena,"""Part of how she feels""? That's kind of a weird thing to say.",29,3
Anthy,People occasionally say or do things they could never even imagine saying or doing.,29,3
Utena,Does that include you too? ,29,3
Anthy,"Utena-sama, actually, I... ",29,3
Utena,What? ,29,3
Anthy,Nothing. ,29,3
machine,This is Tsuchiya. I'm out. Leave a message.,29,3
Shiori,"You're there, aren't you. I know. ",29,3
Shiori,What's wrong with at least listening to me?,29,3
Touga,"Looks like you weren't as good as you said you were, either.",29,3
Ruka,True. But I figured as much. ,29,3
Touga,Say what? ,29,3
Ruka,Tenjou Utena is a terrifying opponent. ,29,3
Ruka,Someone of my talent is no match for her.,29,3
Ruka,But I've got my reasons for having to win no matter what.,29,3
Touga,"Did you ""figure"" that too? ",29,3
Ruka,"""There are no miracles"". A saying of hers.",29,3
Shiori,"Juri-san, so it's you. ",29,3
Shiori,What do you want? ,29,3
Juri,Shiori... ,29,3
Shiori,"You came to laugh at me and feel all superior, didn't you?!",29,3
Juri,Of course not- ,29,3
Shiori,You suck worse and worse every day! Did you expect me to cry for help on your shoulder?!,29,3
Shiori,"Too bad, but I'm not gonna do what you want me to.",29,3
girl,Thank you very much! ,29,3
Ruka,Are you serious? ,29,3
Juri,Of course. ,29,3
Ruka,"What a surprise. Just a little bit ago you were telling me to keep my hands off,...",29,3
Ruka,...and now you're telling me to make up with her.,29,3
Juri,If that's what makes her happy. ,29,3
Ruka,"Sorry, but I can't grant your request. ",29,3
Juri,Ruka! ,29,3
Ruka,Your friendship for her impresses me. ,29,3
Ruka,"But she's selfish, pushy, and self-centered, and a liar on top of that.",29,3
Ruka,"Sorry, but who the hell would want someone like that?",29,3
Juri,"You bastard, who the hell do you think you are?!",29,3
Ruka,Don't try to dictate what I do. ,29,3
Juri,Who gave you the right to torment her? ,29,3
Ruka,It's none of your business. ,29,3
Juri,What kind of mean-spirited asshole have you become?,29,3
Ruka,And what makes you think you can tell others what to do?,29,3
Ruka,But how about this instead? ,29,3
Ruka,I was thinking about going out with you next.,29,3
Juri,Who the fuck would go out with you?! ,29,3
Ruka,"Don't you actually love me, the Captain of the Fencing Club?",29,3
Juri,You bastard! You've insulted me enough! ,29,3
Ruka,Don't hold back now. ,29,3
Juri,Who's hol- ,29,3
Juri,When did you-? ,29,3
Juri,Sto...stop it! Ruka! ,29,3
Ruka,I've changed my mind. I'll do what you said.,29,3
Ruka,I'll make up with her. ,29,3
Ruka,Do you hate me so much you can't stand it any more?,29,3
Juri,Wait. ,29,3
Juri,"Ruka, duel me. ",29,3
Juri,"If I lose, I'll do whatever the hell you want me to.",29,3
Juri,"But if I win, Shiori- ",29,3
Ruka,I got it. Say no more. ,29,3
Ruka,"Ever since you entered the Fencing Club, you were the star pupil.",29,3
Ruka,"No matter what surrounded you, you never lost your brilliance.",29,3
Ruka,Your talent is vastly greater than mine. ,29,3
Juri,You're exaggerating. ,29,3
Ruka,Am I? ,29,3
Ruka,There's someone I want you to meet. ,29,3
Ruka,"Listen, can't you hear it? ",29,3
Ruka,If your soul has not truly given up... ,29,3
Ruka,...you should be able to hear... ,29,3
Ruka,...the sound... ,29,3
Ruka,...resounding across the Ends of the World.,29,3
Juri,What's that sound?! ,29,3
Ruka,"Sorry to keep you waiting, Touga. Your line.",29,3
Touga,"Now, allow us to invite you, to the world you desire!",29,3
Ruka,"Now, get in. You said you'd do whatever I told you.",29,3
Juri,Where do you intend to take me? ,29,3
playback,"Tsuchiya-senpai, I have no one but you.",29,3
playback,"Tsuchiya-senpai, I have no one but you.",29,3
Juri,Do you enjoy hurting her that much? ,29,3
Ruka,"If we raise your latent abilities to their maximum, nobody could beat you.",29,3
Ruka,I'm the one who brings out your abilities. ,29,3
Ruka,Our combination can beat Tenjou Utena...and obtain the Power of Miracles.,29,3
Juri,Did you corner Shiori and I this much just for that?,29,3
Ruka,A sacrifice must be made for a miracle to occur.,29,3
Juri,That's not fair! Do you want the Power of Miracles that badly?!,29,3
Ruka,You're the one who wants the Power of Miracles!,29,3
Juri,Shiori isn't some fucking tool of yours! ,29,3
Ruka,"""Believe in miracles, that your wishes come true""...aren't those your words?",29,3
Juri,You're misunderstanding something. I don't care if my wishes don't come true.,29,3
Juri,"And even if I obtained the Power of Miracles, the only thing I'd wish for...",29,3
Juri,...is freeing her from you. That's all. ,29,3
Juri,I'm not letting you get your way any more.,29,3
Juri,"And to see that you don't, I'll even take you up on your proposition.",29,3
Ruka,"So, we have a deal. ",29,3
Akio,"I'll show you the Ends of the World. Yes, even you two.",29,3
Utena,Arisugawa-senpai...you too? ,29,3
Juri,"After school, at the Arena of Duels. ",29,3
Utena,Senpai! ,29,3
Ruka,"This time it's the main event, Tenjou Utena-kun.",29,3
Juri,Do it. ,29,3
Anthy,"O roses of noble memory, I beseech thee:",29,3
Anthy,Appear before me. ,29,3
Anthy,Grant me the power to Revolutionize the World!,29,3
Utena,Grant me the power to Revolutionize the World!,29,3
Ruka,Hidden wishes... ,29,3
Ruka,How painful they must be. ,29,3
Ruka,"What're you waiting for, Juri?! ",29,3
Ruka,"Juri, she's a fool. ",29,3
Ruka,Because she doesn't realize that her miracle is standing atop someone else's sacrifice.,29,3
Ruka,But that's the sort of person who receives miracles!,29,3
Ruka,"Unfair, isn't it! Juri!! ",29,3
Ruka,Juri! ,29,3
Utena,"Why, senpai? ",29,3
Ruka,"Juri, don't worry. ",29,3
Ruka,"Don't worry, Juri. ",29,3
Juri,"""Don't worry""....huh? ",29,3
Nanami,"Oh, so Juri's back to being Captain? ",29,3
Miki,Yeah. Tsuchiya-senpai hasn't been coming to school these days.,29,3
Nanami,"Oh really? What a shame, and after he recovered and everything.",29,3
Nanami,"Well, don't blame me if he gets expelled for poor attendance.",29,3
Miki,"Hey, it looks like that girl got hurt. ",29,3
Nanami,Well there's nothing to worry about with Juri in charge.,29,3
girl,I'm so sorry...and with a local meet coming up and all...,29,3
Juri,Don't worry. Just concentrate on healing that leg.,29,3
girl,I'm really sorry for causing trouble at a time like this.,29,3
Shadow,"Hey, do you know? ",29,3
Shadow,Hmm? ,29,3
Shadow,That patient died yesterday. ,29,3
Shadow,He was such a babe too! What a shame. ,29,3
Shadow,And after he kept saying he wanted to fence again after leaving the hospital.,29,3
Shadow,It seems he knew how sick he was. But he forced his way out of the hospital anyway and went backto school.,29,3
Shadow,I bet there's somebody he loved in the Fencing Club.,29,3
Shadow,"Come to think of it, he was always saying:",29,3
Shadow,"""I want to give the Power of Miracles to the one I love. I want to free her.""",29,3
Shadow,"What's that supposed to mean, I wonder? ",29,3
Shadow,Who knows... ,29,3
Juri,Are you doing well? The next time we meet...,29,3
Juri,...there's one thing I really want to ask.,29,3
Juri,What hopes had you entrusted to the Power of Miracles?,29,3
Juri,And who were they for? ,29,3
Juri,I pray that they come true. ,29,3
guy,"Well like, I said it was my first kiss, but she just ran away.",30,3
Wakaba,Saying it's your first kiss is pretty shameless.,30,3
guy,But saying it's your first makes a better impression.,30,3
Wakaba,"Look, people see right through that kind of lie.",30,3
Wakaba,All it does is get her to start not trusting you.,30,3
Utena,"First kiss, huh? ",30,3
Utena,I wonder if that's what that was. ,30,3
title,The Barefoot Girl ,30,3
Akio,"I don't know if they came out well, but...",30,3
Utena,"Wow! Akio-san, you really can do everything can't you.",30,3
Akio,Shouldn't you praise me after you try it?,30,3
Utena,"But like, guys who can bake cakes are way rare.",30,3
Anthy,Coming! ,30,3
Wakaba,Hi! I'm Shinohara Wakaba! ,30,3
Utena,Such great timing she has... ,30,3
Wakaba,Did Akio-san bake this cake? ,30,3
Akio,Please help yourself. I can't guarantee how it'll taste.,30,3
Wakaba,"Wow! Akio-san, you really can do everything can't you.",30,3
Utena,I just said that. ,30,3
Akio,Please don't praise me until after you've tasted it.,30,3
Wakaba,"But like, guys who can bake cakes are way rare.",30,3
Utena,I just said that too. ,30,3
Wakaba,Party-pooper. ,30,3
Utena,"Look, Akio-san's already got a fiancee. ",30,3
Wakaba,"Hey, that doesn't matter where love's concerned.",30,3
Utena,Yeah right. ,30,3
Akio,What're we talking about? ,30,3
Utena,Nothing. ,30,3
Wakaba,"Oh, nothing at all! ",30,3
Akio,Working on your feminine wiles? ,30,3
Utena,"Oh, 'course not. ",30,3
Wakaba,Utena. ,30,3
Wakaba,If you keep being so uptight... ,30,3
teacher,...you'll never fall in love. ,30,3
teacher,Behave more like a girl! I'm saying this for your sake.,30,3
teacher,Wearing boy's clothing isn't the slightest bit attractive.,30,3
Utena,"But you know, everyone says this style's pretty hip.",30,3
teacher,"What's this ""everyone says""? All that matters is good sense that I decide as guidance counselor!",30,3
Utena,"Yeah, but... ",30,3
teacher,"Vice Principal, please tell her straight off.",30,3
teacher,"You must abide by the rules. Girls should wear nice, fluttering skirts.",30,3
Utena,Who thought that one up? ,30,3
Akio,What seems to be the problem? ,30,3
teacher,"Oh my, Mr. Chairman. ",30,3
Utena,Akio-san. ,30,3
teacher,"What do you mean, ""Akio-san""?! ",30,3
Utena,"Well, um, I... ",30,3
Akio,Vice Principal. ,30,3
teacher,Yes sir. ,30,3
Akio,I'd like to attend tonight's Middle School staff social.,30,3
teacher,"Oh my my my, I've always wanted rub shoulders and chat with the Chairman of the Board.",30,3
teacher,"So, Mr. Chairman, err...regarding the members of the inspection team of our sister campus in Amsterdam...",30,3
Akio,Ah yes. The formal announcement from the selection committee may come out any day now.,30,3
teacher,"I was wondering if, by any chance, you could perhaps mention my name...",30,3
Akio,I'll keep that in mind. ,30,3
Akio,"Now, I have some business with this girl. I'm borrowing her.",30,3
teacher,"How fabulous...the Chairman's looks, and fashion...",30,3
Akio,"Oh, and take care not to constrict the students too much with the rules.",30,3
Akio,I'm counting on you to offer guidance that maximizes the student's independence.,30,3
Utena,Umm... ,30,3
Utena,"What ""business"" did you have with me? ",30,3
Akio,You dummy. I don't have any such thing. ,30,3
Akio,I'm a fan of that valiant style of yours too.,30,3
Utena,It's not that great... ,30,3
Akio,"Besides, seeing you standing up for your beliefs against those nagging teachers...",30,3
Akio,"...seemed somehow strong, and noble to me.",30,3
Utena,Are you sure the Chairman of the Board should be saying things like that?,30,3
Akio,"Who cares? After all, you're my sister's - no, my close friend.",30,3
Utena,Really. ,30,3
Akio,Let's go. ,30,3
Utena,Dummy! What're you thinking. He's already got a...,30,3
Utena,"Hey, I've been seeing that car around a lot lately.",30,3
Akio,It's a popular model this year. ,30,3
Akio,Don't you like it? ,30,3
Utena,"No, that's not it... ",30,3
Wakaba,U-te-na... ,30,3
Utena,Wakaba. ,30,3
Akio,"Hello, Shinohara-san. ",30,3
Wakaba,"Hi there! Um, could you call me ""Wakaba"" instead of ""Shinohara-san""?",30,3
Wakaba,"Hey, what's with sneaking out here all alone with him? Gettin' pretty involved, aren't we?",30,3
Wakaba,You about to go on a date or something? ,30,3
Utena,Of course not. We're just bumped into each other.,30,3
Wakaba,Really? ,30,3
Utena,Really. ,30,3
Wakaba,Really really? ,30,3
Utena,Damn straight! ,30,3
Wakaba,"In that case, Akio-san, could I go driving with you?",30,3
Utena,Hey now. ,30,3
Wakaba,I'm sure meeting you like this today must be fate or something.,30,3
Utena,You've been coming over to play every day.,30,3
Wakaba,Pretty please with sugar on top! I'll remember it my whole life!,30,3
Akio,"Well, let's see. If around two hours is alright, I think I can spend time with you.",30,3
Wakaba,Yes!! ,30,3
Utena,"Man, talk about pushy. ",30,3
Wakaba,"Uh-uh, you stay here. ",30,3
Utena,How come? ,30,3
Wakaba,Cause...a date is something two people do by themselves.,30,3
Wakaba,"Right, Akio-san? ",30,3
Utena,Oh really. ,30,3
Utena,"Well, later. ",30,3
Wakaba,See ya. ,30,3
Wakaba,Ba-ha-hi! ,30,3
Utena,Ba-ha-hi! ,30,3
Wakaba,"Ah, what a nice memory. ",30,3
Utena,"Oh, really. ",30,3
Wakaba,"The ocean was so pretty, the breeze felt so good...",30,3
Wakaba,It was the bestest possible date. ,30,3
Utena,Yeah yeah. ,30,3
Utena,"Anyways, I think you know already, but Akio-san's-",30,3
Wakaba,"Already got a fiancee, right? ",30,3
Wakaba,And here I was in such a good mood and stuff.,30,3
Wakaba,It was just a drive. Nothing more. ,30,3
Utena,You sure about that? ,30,3
Wakaba,"Ah ha, well look who's jealous! ",30,3
Utena,No way in hell! ,30,3
Anthy,Good morning. ,30,3
Wakaba,Morning! ,30,3
Utena,"Oh, good morning, Himemiya... ",30,3
Anthy,"Good morning, Utena-sama. ",30,3
Utena,It couldn't be. ,30,3
Utena,It just couldn't be. ,30,3
Utena,Who I love is my Prince... ,30,3
Utena,Nobody but the Prince who gave me this ring...,30,3
Utena,Why am I this... ,30,3
Utena,Why? WHY? ,30,3
Utena,Why is my heart pounding this hard? ,30,3
Utena,A..ki...o....san... ,30,3
guy,Tenjou! ,30,3
guy,You alright? ,30,3
Utena,"Yeah, nothing major. ",30,3
guy,But what's up messing up like that? It ain't like you.,30,3
Utena,Sorry 'bout that. ,30,3
guy,"Watch out, okay? ",30,3
Utena,Sure. ,30,3
Utena,Something's definitely wrong with me. ,30,3
Utena,Ow... ,30,3
Anthy,"Are you okay, Utena-sama? ",30,3
Utena,Sort of... Sorry for the trouble. ,30,3
Anthy,Not at all. But why don't we go put some ice on it in the infirmary?,30,3
Utena,"Say, Himemiya? ",30,3
Anthy,Yes? ,30,3
Utena,You and I... ,30,3
Anthy,Hmm? ,30,3
Utena,Akio-san. ,30,3
Anthy,"Brother, Utena-sama is... ",30,3
Akio,What's wrong? ,30,3
Akio,"Now, hop in. You should have that looked at properly at the hospital.",30,3
Utena,Sorry about this. ,30,3
Akio,Take care of things here. ,30,3
Anthy,Okay. ,30,3
Utena,Why can't Himemiya ride too? ,30,3
Akio,Uh-uh. ,30,3
Akio,A date is something two people do by themselves.,30,3
Akio,Your best friend taught me that. Am I wrong?,30,3
Akio,"Later, Anthy. ",30,3
Anthy,"Farewell, brother. ",30,3
Anthy,Ba-ha-hi! ,30,3
Utena,"Um, Akio-san? ",30,3
Akio,Hmm? ,30,3
Utena,"I'm really sorry about all of this, making you go all the way to the hospital and all.",30,3
Akio,Don't worry so much. We're already just like family aren't we?,30,3
Utena,Yes. ,30,3
Utena,Ummm.... ,30,3
Akio,Hmm? ,30,3
Utena,"The ceremony's next spring, right? ",30,3
Utena,Kanae-san's such a wonderful person. ,30,3
Akio,True. ,30,3
Akio,"Well, here we are. ",30,3
Utena,Thank you. ,30,3
Akio,Does it hurt? ,30,3
Utena,I-I'm just fine. ,30,3
Akio,"The doctor said you shouldn't walk around today, right?",30,3
Utena,"Wha-? No, I'm fine. I can walk. ",30,3
Akio,You shouldn't force yourself. I'll carry you.,30,3
Utena,"You're a playboy, aren't you? ",30,3
Akio,Why? ,30,3
Utena,"I mean, you seem really good at making women feel good.",30,3
Akio,Really? ,30,3
Utena,"You're sort of, not very Chairman-like, or maybe...kind of bad.",30,3
Akio,"Well, you don't do what people tell you, and go around wearing guy's clothes.",30,3
Akio,We may just be two of a kind. ,30,3
Utena,But I'm doing it because of my Prince. ,30,3
Akio,Prince? ,30,3
Utena,I want to meet this Prince I loved in my past...and so...,30,3
Akio,I'll carry you on my back. Or would you prefer in my arms?,30,3
Shadow,"Those shoes, those shoes, those shoes! ",30,3
Shadow,Throw out those shoes at once! ,30,3
Shadow,Why should I do that to my precious red shoes?,30,3
Shadow,If you wear those you'll have to go on dancing until you die!,30,3
Shadow,There are things...one does...even if one knows...they're wrong!,30,3
Shadow,After all...don't you have...the same red shoes...as mine?,30,3

Utena,Yes? ,30,3
Anthy,Aren't you hungry? ,30,3
Utena,Why? ,30,3
Anthy,It didn't look like you touched most of your dinner.,30,3
Utena,Oh. I wasn't that hungry. ,30,3
Utena,"See, about Wakaba. ",30,3
Anthy,Yes? ,30,3
Utena,"Wakaba said a while ago that there's no such thing as a ""wrong"" love.",30,3
Utena,That love wasn't something you can control.,30,3
Utena,"But there really are people you mustn't fall in love with, aren't there.",30,3
Anthy,I don't know much about that. ,30,3
Anthy,"But, I think that just like Wakaba-san said, ""love"" has a part of it that you can't control.",30,3
Utena,You really think so? ,30,3
Utena,"Come to think of it, do you have anybody you love?",30,3
Anthy,"Yes, I do. A Prince. ",30,3
Touga,"Well my goodness. Tenjou Utena, is it?",30,3
Touga,The owner of the glass slipper... ,30,3
Akio,"That's right. You've fallen for her, haven't you?",30,3
Touga,Yeah. ,30,3
Touga,It sure was a shock losing that Duel to her.,30,3
Touga,"No, it wasn't losing the duel, it was realizing there was a girl who could shake my way of thinking.",30,3
Touga,That was the first time anything's ever made me reconsider how I've led my life.,30,3
Akio,You've got good eyes. She'll be a good woman.,30,3
Touga,"That's right, Mr. Chairman. ",30,3
Akio,Utena-san? ,30,3
Akio,You also didn't eat very much yesterday...are you feeling ill?,30,3
Utena,"No, um... ",30,3

Akio,Your mother? ,30,3
mother,"It's been a while, Akio-san. ",30,3
Akio,"Mother, what brings you here? ",30,3
mother,I have something to discuss with you. ,30,3
Akio,Regarding what matter? ,30,3
Akio,I believe the performance of my duties is proceeding without incident.,30,3
Akio,Could it be something that cannot be discussed over the phone?,30,3
mother,"Akio-san...have you been avoiding my daughter, Kanae?",30,3
mother,Your position at this school is based on your getting married to my daughter.,30,3
mother,And don't forget that engagements can be canceled at any time.,30,3
Akio,I'm being good to Kanae-san. So much that I'm thinking of naming a comet after her when I find one.,30,3
Akio,Besides. Look. This is Kanae-san's favorite fragrance.,30,3
Akio,"I'm always wearing the cologne Kanae-san likes, and when we're all alone together...",30,3
Akio,And how is the real Chairman doing? ,30,3

mother,You. You're my only Prince. ,30,3

Narration,Was the ring from the prince meant as an engagement ring?,31,3
Narration,"That part was good, ",31,3
Narration,"but because of the strength of her admiration for the prince,",31,3

Nanami,"If you want my brother, he's out right now.",31,3
Nanami,If you're in a hurry why don't you try calling his cel phone.,31,3
Nanami,"Oh, you don't know it? Well that won't work then.",31,3
Nanami,I can tell him for you if you want. ,31,3
Nanami,What matter is this- ,31,3
Nanami,What a stupid girl. I'm not like you all.,31,3
Nanami,My brother and I are siblings. We're blood relations.,31,3
Touga,"Hello? Oh, it's you. ",31,3
Touga,"Yeah. No, that's not it. Yeah. ",31,3
Touga,Of course I wouldn't go out with that girl. Yeah.,31,3
Touga,My cel phone was out for repairs. Really. ,31,3
Touga,Of course not...I wouldn't turn it off when you might call.,31,3
Touga,"You're the only one, baby. ",31,3
Nanami,"Wow, what a surprise! ",31,3
Nanami,It says here that matches between type B people are the worst.,31,3
Nanami,"That's gotta be a lie, right? ",31,3
Nanami,"Our father's B, our mother's B, I'm B - we're a type-B family.",31,3
Nanami,But it says that we're incompatible- ,31,3
Touga,Not interested. ,31,3
Nanami,Where're you going? ,31,3
Touga,The shower. Wanna come with me? ,31,3
Touga,Just kidding. ,31,3
Nanami,We used to do everything together. ,31,3
Nanami,"Eat, and sleep, and bathe... ",31,3
Nanami,But now my brother won't pay any attention to me at all.,31,3
Nanami,Must siblings have to grow apart like this?,31,3
Touga,[indistinctly] Hold on a second... ,31,3

Nanami,Maybe you got dumped. ,31,3

girl,I waited all the way until morning. ,31,3
girl,All the food I made for you went to waste...,31,3

Nanami,Oniisama is mine. I won't let anybody have him.,31,3
Nanami,Not anybody... ,31,3
Touga,How about tonight? Dinner or something... ,31,3
Utena,"You never learn, do you? There's no way I'd do that.",31,3
Touga,It's rude not to invite a girl to dinner. ,31,3
Anthy,"That's an Italian proverb, isn't it? ",31,3
Utena,"Mr. President, are you from a Latin family?",31,3
Touga,Do I look like it? ,31,3
Utena,You don't not look like it... ,31,3
Nanami,It's all your fault! ,31,3
Utena,What? ,31,3

Nanami,What a waste for Himemiya Anthy to have such a kind brother like that.,31,3
Utena,How is it a waste if they're siblings? ,31,3

Keiko,"N-nanami-sama, which type were you again?",31,3
Nanami,"I'm type B. My father's type B, my mother's type B, my family's type B.",31,3
Nanami,"Perhaps that's ""B"" for ""beautiful""? ",31,3
Yuuko,So Touga-sama's B too? ,31,3
Nanami,"No, my brother's type A, the perfectionist. ",31,3
Keiko,"Um, Nanami-sama? What's your father's bloodtype?",31,3
Nanami,I said B. ,31,3
Keiko,And your mother's? ,31,3
Nanami,She's B too. ,31,3
Keiko,And Touga-sama is... ,31,3
Nanami,I just told you it's A! ,31,3
Yuuko,"But, I don't think type B parents could have a type A child...",31,3
Keiko,Are you and Touga-sama maybe not related by blood...?,31,3
Nanami,"Shut up! Do you see any siblings as smart, popular, beautiful, and perfect as us?",31,3
Nanami,Even if we aren't blood relatives- ,31,3
Nanami,That can't be! ,31,3
Nanami,Why? ,31,3

girl,"Hey, Touga. You can hear me, right? ",31,3
girl,"Touga, please- ",31,3
Nanami,That simply...can't be. ,31,3
Nanami,That my brother and I...aren't really siblings...,31,3
Nanami,That we're not blood relatives... ,31,3
Touga,"What's wrong, lying there with the lights off?",31,3
Nanami,"Um, well...I fell asleep without noticing... ",31,3
Touga,"I see. By the way, do you know what happened to my cel phone?",31,3
Touga,"I've been looking for it since yesterday, but I can't find it.",31,3
Nanami,No idea. ,31,3
Touga,You okay? Your face is red. ,31,3
Nanami,I'm okay... ,31,3

Utena,Something...? ,31,3
Miki,It's abnormal for Nanami-kun to part from Touga-sempai.,31,3
Utena,Abnormal isn't it... ,31,3
Miki,So- ,31,3
Juri,So- ,31,3
Miki,Go ahead. ,31,3
Juri,Thanks. Haven't you heard anything? ,31,3

Nanami,Please forgive my being so selfish. ,31,3
Akio,That's fine. Making sure that each an every student has a pleasant time at the Academy is my job.,31,3
Nanami,Aren't you going to ask what happened? ,31,3
Akio,My real dream is turning the Chairman's Wing into a harem.,31,3
Nanami,Huh? ,31,3
Akio,Just kidding. ,31,3
Nanami,Oh. ,31,3
Akio,Please feel free to tell me anything. As though I was family.,31,3
Nanami,Okay. ,31,3

Anthy,"Well, my brother draws no distinction between women.",31,3
Utena,Is that true? ,31,3
Anthy,I'm joking. ,31,3
Utena,Of course! Akio-san couldn't be that kind of person.,31,3

Miki,"Oh, really? ",32,3
Nanami,It sucks. I feel like I don't want to be there even one second extra.,32,3

Nanami,Keiko. ,32,3
Anthy,Huh? What's wrong? ,32,3
Nanami,I won't forgive you even if I'd forgive everyone else. Who told you you could get close to my brother?!,32,3
Nanami,I hope you're ready for this. ,32,3
Nanami,Why? Why are you with this girl? ,32,3
Nanami,"I know you can't help going out with women. But please, anyone but her.",32,3
Nanami,There must be someone better suited for you.,32,3
Touga,Are you trying to say that you're that person?,32,3
Keiko,"What do you mean ""this girl""?! How are we two any different?!",32,3
Keiko,Why the hell would I need anyone's permission to touch the one I love?,32,3
Keiko,You really are messed up. You make me sick.,32,3
Keiko,"I hate the air here...hey, let's go somewhere else.",32,3
Touga,"Nanami, you'll understand soon. ",32,3
Nanami,"Please wait. You were joking just now, right?",32,3
Nanami,That all your kindness toward me was just a lie...,32,3
Nanami,"You're just teasing me again, right? ",32,3
Nanami,I've become just like them. ,32,3
Nanami,Like all those women swarming around my brother like flies...,32,3
Nanami,There's nothing left holding us together anymore.,32,3
Nanami,Nothing! ,32,3
Anthy,Now what? ,32,3
Utena,Isn't Kanae-san going home yet? ,32,3
Utena,"It's already eight o'clock. Almost time for dinner, right?",32,3
Anthy,Yes. ,32,3
Utena,Huh? ,32,3
Utena,Are you all by yourself? ,32,3
Anthy,Yes. ,32,3
Utena,Oh. ,32,3
Anthy,Is something the matter? ,32,3
Utena,Uh-uh. ,32,3
Anthy,Shall I make something? ,32,3
Utena,"Hey, I wonder if Kanae-san's gonna eat with us.",32,3
Anthy,I don't know. ,32,3
Utena,What a pain. Once Akio-san starts stargazing he just never quits.,32,3
Anthy,True. ,32,3
Utena,"I bet you're hungry too, right Nanami? ",32,3
Nanami,Not really. ,32,3
Utena,Oh. ,32,3
Anthy,I'll have shaved ice ready in a second. ,32,3
Utena,"Well, that's okay, but... ",32,3
Utena,I'll just go up and ask him. ,32,3
Anthy,"No, don't! ",32,3
Utena,Huh? ,32,3
Anthy,"Utena-sama, you musn't disturb their time together.",32,3
Anthy,Let them enjoy their time alone. ,32,3
Anthy,Okay? ,32,3
Utena,I see. You're right. ,32,3
Utena,"Sorry. You really do care about your brother, don't you?",32,3
Anthy,Don't mention it. ,32,3
Nanami,She's too scary... ,32,3
Anthy,Who me? Don't mention it. ,32,3
Utena,Can't sleep? ,32,3
Nanami,Did you two sleep every night facing each other like this?,32,3
Utena,Yeah. ,32,3
Nanami,"That's messed up. You're like wacked, or dense, or something.",32,3
Utena,"Hey, don't complain while you're hogging someone else's bed.",32,3
Nanami,I'm sure she's overjoyed. ,32,3
Nanami,This is the perfect excuse to go sleep with her beloved brother.,32,3
Utena,"Well, those two are really close siblings. ",32,3
Nanami,"Man, you really don't get it. ",32,3
Nanami,No wonder you can stand living around those nasty siblings.,32,3
Utena,Siblings are nice. Like they always understand each other's feelings...,32,3
Utena,"Even you an Touga, if you don't lose hold of your relationship up till now...",32,3
Nanami,Don't associate me with him. ,32,3
Nanami,What would you know? ,32,3
Utena,Sorry. ,32,3
Touga,"That was just an act. If not for that, there's no way I'd hang around her.",32,3
Touga,"That commonplace, boring woman... ",32,3
girl,"Hello hello? It's me, me. I'm so lonely I can't sleep!",32,3
girl,"Hey, let me hear your voice. ",32,3
Nanami,"What time do you think this is, moron? ",32,3
Nanami,Who is this? At least give me your name.,32,3
Akio,The Ends of the World. ,32,3
Nanami,What? ,32,3
Akio,Kiryuu Touga is waiting. ,32,3
Touga,"Hi, Nanami. Welcome home. ",32,3
Nanami,"Um, there's something I want to ask. ",32,3
Touga,What is it? ,32,3
Nanami,"Brother, do you know the Ends of the World?",32,3
Touga,What do you mean by asking that? ,32,3
Nanami,"I still love you, even now. No matter how you feel about me.",32,3
Nanami,"But, I know we can't go back to the way things were.",32,3
Nanami,"So today, I sent in a request to transfer schools.",32,3
Nanami,"I plan on never seeing you again. So I want to know, this last time.",32,3
Nanami,The truth about my brother. ,32,3
text,School Transfer Request ,32,3
Nanami,How did you get that?! ,32,3
Touga,"Now now, can't you hear it? ",32,3
Touga,If your soul has not truly given up... ,32,3
Touga,...you should be able to hear... ,32,3
Touga,...the sound... ,32,3
Touga,...resounding across the Ends of the World.,32,3
Touga,"Now, allow us to invite you, to the world you desire!",32,3
Akio,Hello. It's time to go driving. ,32,3
Nanami,It's you... ,32,3
Nanami,Just who is this person? ,32,3
Touga,"What do you mean, who is he? As you know perfectly well,",32,3
Touga,he is the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Ohtori Academy.,32,3
Nanami,That's not what I'm asking. ,32,3
Touga,Then what? ,32,3
Nanami,He's not normal. ,32,3
Touga,How is he not normal? ,32,3
Nanami,I saw it. ,32,3
Touga,Saw what? ,32,3
Nanami,That... ,32,3
Nanami,...I can't say. It was so terrifying... ,32,3
Nanami,What's so damn funny? ,32,3
Akio,Whatever you see with those eyes of yours...is nothing other than your own world.,32,3
Nanami,Say what? ,32,3
Akio,The world you see. The world where you exist.,32,3
Akio,"You merely continue to wander the same road, unable to see the way ahead,",32,3
Akio,a labrynthine world with no way out. ,32,3
Akio,That which you should behold is not there.,32,3
Nanami,What is this guy talking about? ,32,3
Nanami,"No, let me go! ",32,3
Touga,Isn't this what you always wanted me to do?,32,3
Nanami,"No, it isn't! ",32,3
Touga,"After all, we're not siblings. ",32,3
Nanami,That's not it! ,32,3
Touga,"Then, what do you want?! ",32,3
Akio,I shall show you the Ends of the World. ,32,3
Akio,"Yes, even you. ",32,3
Aiko,"Keiko, something lucky happened to you, right?",32,3
Keiko,"Well, there's not much to tell. ",32,3
Keiko,"Well, if it isn't Nanami? You want something with us?",32,3
Keiko,But I'll warn you in advance we're different from before.,32,3
Keiko,"After all, we don't have a single shred of reason to do what you tell us.",32,3
Keiko,"What a total waste of time. Kissing ass, apple-polishing, doing errands, and all for someone likeyou.",32,3
Keiko,Just remembering it makes me totally pissed off.,32,3
Keiko,We plan on paying you back starting now. I hope you're ready.,32,3
Keiko,What's with that look in your eyes?! ,32,3
Utena,Himemiya! ,32,3
Utena,"What're you doing, Nanami?! ",32,3
Nanami,I'm not like her. ,32,3
Utena,What're you talking about? ,32,3
Nanami,"Today, after school, at the Arena of Duels.",32,3
Utena,Say what?! Don't be ridiculous! ,32,3
Nanami,Are you saying you don't care what happens to this thing?,32,3
Utena,Nanami... ,32,3
Shadow,"Here, psychokinesis! ",32,3
Shadow,"See, my customer, this is no trick or gimmick!",32,3
Shadow,That's bogus. It's obvious that's a trick.,32,3
Shadow,"Then, here we go again. Psychokinesis! ",32,3
Shadow,It's a sham! A fraud! ,32,3
Shadow,Geez. But what kind of trick could it be?,32,3
Shadow,"How the heck would I know, you con artist?!",32,3
Shadow,Shit...special psychokinesis! ,32,3
Shadow,Bogus...totally bogus... ,32,3
Shadow,"Psychokinesis, maximum power! ",32,3
Shadow,Bogus...bogus... ,32,3
Utena,Touga. Are you the one who put Nanami up to this?,32,3
Touga,No. Nanami came here of her own free will.,32,3
Utena,And you call yourself her brother?! ,32,3
Touga,Nanami and I aren't siblings. I'm sure you know that.,32,3
Touga,You shouldn't just stick your nose into what other people are doing.,32,3
Touga,"Right, Nanami? ",32,3
Nanami,That's right. I want to surpass everything. ,32,3
Nanami,"I'll beat you, and then my brother, myself up to now...everything...",32,3
Utena,You dummy. ,32,3
Anthy,"O roses of noble memory, I implore you.",32,3
Anthy,Reveal thyselves. [cue duel music] Anthy&Utena: Grant me the Power to Revolutionizethe World!,32,3
Nanami,There's no meaning. My brother was part of how I could be me.,32,3
Nanami,I believed... ,32,3
Nanami,that there had to be some sort of bonds between us. But...,32,3
Nanami,there was nothing! ,32,3
Nanami,Nothing at all!! ,32,3
Utena,Does that matter? ,32,3
Utena,"Whatever shape it takes, if the thought is there...",32,3
Nanami,Believe that if you want. ,32,3
Nanami,Go believe in the conclusion that thought leads to!,32,3
Touga,Stop that! ,32,3
Utena,Are you satisfied now? ,32,3
Nanami,Tell me. What do I have? ,32,3
Nanami,Am I just one more insect? ,32,3
Nanami,I can't stand that! ,32,3
Akio,You should tell Nanami-kun the truth. ,32,3
Touga,I suppose so. ,32,3
Akio,You really are blood relations. ,32,3
Touga,Yes. Nanami and I were both sent to the current Kiryuu residence.,32,3
Touga,It was when Nanami was still a baby. ,32,3
Akio,You'd better clear up the misunderstanding fast.,32,3
Touga,But isn't it more romantic to be siblings not bound by blood?,32,3
Akio,Such a bad brother... ,32,3

Narration,"That part was good, ",33,3

Anthy,Yes. ,33,3

Anthy,I didn't want to look at the real stars. ,33,3
Anthy,Have you received tonight's roses? ,33,3
Utena,Today was a total blast. I wonder how long it's been since I've had this much fun?,33,3
Utena,I feel like I rode all the rides I wanted to.,33,3
Utena,Himemiya should've come too. ,33,3
Utena,I'm sure being by herself wasn't this much fun.,33,3
Utena,Did I tell you that I'm an only child? ,33,3
Shadow,"I wonder I wonder, do you know what I wonder?",33,3
Shadow,The stars are really gorgeous tonight. ,33,3

Akio,Of course. ,33,3
Shadow,You've got a really sexy voice. ,33,3
Shadow,"Thanks for your postcard. What sort of work do you do, Mr. ""Ends of the World.""",33,3
Akio,I'm an educator. Plus some minor part time work.,33,3
Shadow,Are educators really allowed to moonlight? ,33,3
Akio,"Well, I've had good luck so far keeping it a secret.",33,3
Shadow,"Thank you very much. Then, let's go straight to the quiz.",33,3
Shadow,"I wonder, I wonder, do you know what I wonder?",33,3
Shadow,Multiple choice. Which of the following three things is eternal?,33,3
Shadow,1. A diamond. 2. A beautiful memory. 3. Canned peaches.,33,3

Shadow,Would be? ,33,3
Akio,"Sorry, I've got another call. ",33,3

Touga,He saved her. ,33,3

Saionji,That's right. I used to think all the time about the Rose Bride's feelings in my own way.,33,3

Ruka,Thank you. You're such a gentle person. ,33,3
Shiori,"Oh no, I'm not- ",33,3

Utena,"A while ago, I messed up when measuring maccaroni and ended up filling this great big pot.",33,3

Utena,Huh? The tables got turned. ,33,3
Shiori,Do you know how much I cared about you?,33,3
Shiori,That's right! I polished your sword every day!,33,3

Utena,"You're a Prince, right? ",34,4
Dios,I can't become her Prince. ,34,4
Utena,Why not? ,34,4
Dios,You're such a gentle child. Thank you for your tears.,34,4
Utena,Then I'll become a Prince! ,34,4
Utena,I'll become her Prince and save her! ,34,4
Dios,"If you can retain that nobility even when you grow up,",34,4
Dios,you may indeed be able to save her from her eternal suffering.,34,4
Dios,But you will surely forget all about this night.,34,4
Dios,"And even if you do remember, you're a girl.",34,4
Dios,Soon you'll become a lady. ,34,4

Akio,"Oh, are you worried about her? ",35,4
Touga,"Well, I'm worried. ",35,4
Akio,How are you worried? ,35,4
Touga,She's my important opponent in the Duels. I was planning on undermining her a bit.,35,4
Akio,Really? In that case that's perfect. Can I entrust something to you?,35,4
Touga,What would that be? ,35,4
Akio,I want you to deliver a present to her. ,35,4
Akio,I don't care what. You choose something suitable.,35,4
Touga,You sure you don't want to choose it yourself?,35,4
Akio,"I don't mind. After all, you're the playboy.",35,4
Akio,Choosing presents should be right up your alley.,35,4
Touga,You don't know her as well as I thought. ,35,4
Touga,You can't sway her that way. ,35,4
Touga,"Actually, I gave her a present as a dress before, but she wasn't the sort to be moved by gifts.",35,4
Akio,Have you forgotten? ,35,4
Akio,She's the kind of girl who treasures an old ring given to her by a man whose name she doesn't evenknow.,35,4
Touga,That's true. That's the thing that binds her.,35,4
Akio,"Well, no matter. ",35,4

Touga,I'm sorry. There's something I really want you to hear.,35,4

Utena,But... ,35,4
Wakaba,Geez! You're too soft! ,35,4
Wakaba,Just don't go anywhere dark alone with him.,35,4
Utena,What's that supposed to mean? ,35,4
Utena,Didn't you wanna consult me about something?! ,35,4
Touga,Don't get impatient. It's true I want to talk with you.,35,4
Utena,"Hey, don't be so reckless! ",35,4
Touga,"Tenjou-kun, I guess being an all-around athlete like you doesn't include horseback riding.",35,4
Utena,Of course it doesn't. There aren't that many people who ride.,35,4
Touga,Really? ,35,4
Touga,But don't horses go hand in hand with the Prince you admire so much?,35,4
Utena,What're you trying to say? ,35,4
Touga,Who knows. ,35,4
Utena,"You dummy, cut it out! ",35,4

Touga,"Oh really?! You sound so smart, Saionji. ",35,4
Touga,You know that much about me? ,35,4
Saionji,"Hell yes. You're arrogant and haughty, and full of confident ambition.",35,4
Touga,"Hey now, that's not a nice thing to say.",35,4
Saionji,"That's the kind of guy you are. You play the gentleman,",35,4
Saionji,"but you've never really loved anyone, and you see everyone else only as pawns to be controlled.",35,4
Saionji,That was your strength. ,35,4
Saionji,But can that sword of yours defeat her now?,35,4

Shadow,Boil me! ,35,4
Shadow,Broil me! ,35,4
Shadow,Slice me! ,35,4
Shadow,Make me into sashimi! ,35,4
Shadow,"Hah, all fish are like that. ",35,4
Shadow,All fish exist for me to use. ,35,4
Shadow,"I don't mean to brag, but there's no fish I couldn't catch.",35,4
Shadow,"Wow, is that so? ",35,4
Shadow,All the fish in the sea are at my beck and call.,35,4
Shadow,"Oh, I caught another. ",35,4
Shadow,What's this? It's not doing what I want it to.,35,4
Shadow,Is this some new breed of fish? This's never happened before!,35,4
Shadow,What the hell are you- ,35,4
Shadow,"Shh. I'm a ""koi"" [Japanese for ""goldfish"", and for ""love""].",35,4
Shadow,How could a koi be in the ocean?! ,35,4
Shadow,"I wonder I wonder, do you know what I wonder?",35,4
Akio,Don't worry. See? ,35,4
Utena,Yeah. ,35,4
Akio,"His body's big, but he's quite gentle. ",35,4
Utena,It's too much to ask for...a Prince on a white horse...,35,4
Akio,They're very timid animals. ,35,4
Akio,You have to communicate well with them and get them to trust you.,35,4
Utena,Just like with people. ,35,4
Akio,He's telling me that he likes you too. ,35,4
Utena,Really? ,35,4
Anthy,Utena-sama? Utena-sama? ,35,4
Anthy,You'll catch cold. Utena-sama... ,35,4
Akio,Looks like I won the game. ,35,4
Touga,Nope. It's a draw. ,35,4
Touga,She didn't like the present after all. Just like I thought.,35,4
Akio,She was bewildered. Maybe you didn't pick a good gift-,35,4
Touga,There was no mistake in the choice of gift.,35,4
Touga,"Besides, they suited her very well. ",35,4
Akio,I'd love to see that. She's supposed to become an attractive princess after all.,35,4
Akio,"Not a Prince, but a princess. I'm sure you agree.",35,4
Touga,Well now. Who knows. ,35,4
Akio,I'm looking forward to the next Duel. ,35,4
Akio,The Prince who will revolutionize the world...,35,4
Akio,But I'm praying...for your success. ,35,4
Utena,"Living's...kinda disgusting, isn't it?",35,4
Touga,Really. ,35,4
Utena,Yeah. It's disgusting. ,35,4
Utena,Why is everybody alive if they'll just end up dying?,35,4
Utena,And why didn't I realize that until today?,35,4
Utena,"There can't be anything eternal, can there?",35,4
Saionji,Something eternal? ,35,4
Utena,So it's okay. I'm never leaving this coffin again.,35,4
Saionji,Who would have thought that that girl was Tenjou Utena...,35,4
Saionji,That girl who was inside the coffin. ,35,4
Touga,She's still all alone within the coffin. ,35,4
Touga,"In order to save her, I'll beat her. ",35,4
Saionji,Don't tell me you actually love Tenjou Utena?,35,4
Touga,"Well, I wonder. ",35,4
Touga,I don't even know myself. ,35,4
Saionji,We've gotten a lot of letters to date.,35,4
Saionji,From the Ends of the World. ,35,4
Saionji,"And, as written, we've fought a lot of Duels.",35,4
Touga,But I bet this will be my last letter. ,35,4
Saionji,"We don't need this ""chaban"" anymore. [""chaban"" = tea server / charade]",35,4
Saionji,You don't need to get letters. ,35,4
Touga,You serve him directly. Just get his orders firsthand.,35,4
Saionji,Are you really happy with that? Why are you kissing his ass that much?,35,4
Touga,He's the one who saved her back then. ,35,4
Saionji,"Oh, I see. ",35,4
Touga,I want to become like him. I want power like his.,35,4
Saionji,Are you so sure? ,35,4
Touga,What? ,35,4
Saionji,It may be that the Chairman saved her back then.,35,4
Saionji,"But she's still in the coffin. No, not just her.",35,4
Saionji,We're in our coffins too. ,35,4
Utena,"Hey, stop that Chu-chu. ",35,4
Utena,That's not a caramel. ,35,4
Utena,"Okay okay, I'll show you what's inside. ",35,4
Utena,"Hey, whaddya think, Chu-Chu? ",35,4
Utena,You attach these to your ears like this.,35,4
Utena,Hey... ,35,4
Anthy,What is it? ,35,4
Utena,Nothing... ,35,4
Utena,I feel like I was just about to remember something important...,35,4
Utena,What... ,35,4
Utena,Please...don't open this coffin.,36,4
Saionji,Who would have thought that that girl was Tenjou Utena...,36,4
Saionji,That girl who was inside the coffin. ,36,4
Touga,She's still all alone within the coffin. ,36,4
Touga,"In order to save her, I'll beat her. ",36,4
Saionji,It may be that the Chairman saved her back then.,36,4
Saionji,"But she's still in the coffin. No, not just her.",36,4
Saionji,We're in our coffins too. ,36,4
text,And the Gates of Night Open ,36,4
Akio,"So, what do you think? ",36,4
Akio,"Once you get used to it, it feels pretty good, doesn't it?",36,4
Utena,Yes...my heart was pounding. A lot. ,36,4
Akio,I see. I'm glad. ,36,4
Utena,It's been a really long time since I've spent time out in nature like this.,36,4
Utena,I feel like I'm dreaming or something. ,36,4
Utena,It was really fun. ,36,4
Akio,You're beautiful. The very image of a princess amidst the forest.,36,4
Utena,When you say that sort of thing...it sounds like you really mean it.,36,4
Akio,It's true. ,36,4
Touga,Welcome back. ,36,4
Akio,Thanks. ,36,4
Juri,I wonder why. ,36,4
Juri,"For some reaon, she looks like a girl to me now.",36,4
Miki,Well of course Tenjou-senpai's a girl. ,36,4
Juri,I know that. But... ,36,4
Miki,"Actually, she looks that way to me too. ",36,4
Juri,Really. ,36,4
Miki,"But, isn't that something wonderful? ",36,4
Juri,Do you really think so? ,36,4
Juri,"Something's about to change. No - not ""something"".",36,4
Juri,Everything. Everything in this school is about to change.,36,4
Miki,"Everything in the school...then, it's like...",36,4
Juri,...a Revolution? ,36,4
Miki,Yes. ,36,4
Juri,That's right. The day of Revolution is fast approaching.,36,4
Juri,"But what is this frenzied, horrible feeling?",36,4
Touga,Whaddya think? Pleasant vibrations aren't they?,36,4
Saionji,They're not moving me. ,36,4
Touga,Really. ,36,4
Saionji,You've got messed-up tastes. That's not good.,36,4
Touga,I take it you don't like it because I'm driving?,36,4
Saionji,What I don't like is being dominated. ,36,4
Saionji,Letting someone that deep into my heart.,36,4
Touga,You've always been a guy who couldn't hide his hostility.,36,4
Saionji,Hell if I care. ,36,4
Saionji,So what're you gonna do? You planning to fight Tenjou Utena like this?,36,4
Saionji,Just like the Ends of the World is telling you to?,36,4
Akio,She was beautiful. ,36,4
Touga,"Her, you mean? ",36,4
Akio,"Yeah. Pure, and magnificent. ",36,4
Akio,A peerless princess. ,36,4
Akio,My precious one. ,36,4
Touga,I know that. ,36,4
Saionji,We must rise from our coffins! ,36,4
Saionji,From within the coffins that the Ends of the World has prepared for us!,36,4
Touga,I'll give you an answer. Tonight. ,36,4
Saionji,Tonight! ,36,4
Touga,Saionji. ,36,4
Saionji,Yeah. ,36,4
Touga,Standing up is dangerous. ,36,4
Saionji,Right. ,36,4
Utena,"Oh brother, you'll catch cold. ",36,4
Utena,I wonder if Himemiya's with Akio-san again.,36,4
Utena,"Hey, Chu-Chu, are you always alone like this while Himemiya's with her brother?",36,4
Utena,Mr. President. ,36,4
Touga,I have something important to talk to you. Will you accompany me?,36,4
Utena,"You're joking, right? Why're you bugging me at this hour?",36,4
Touga,What if I said I wanted to talk about the Ends of the World?,36,4
Utena,Okay. ,36,4
Utena,This is my first time being in the Arena of Duels at night.,36,4
Touga,Are you scared? ,36,4
Utena,It's not that. It's just that it feels different from how it usually does.,36,4
Touga,How does it feel? ,36,4
Utena,How does it feel? Well... ,36,4
Touga,Romantic? ,36,4
Utena,No way. ,36,4
Touga,I'd be glad if the two of us could go up alone like this into the heavens.,36,4
Utena,"Hey, don't get so close to me. ",36,4
Touga,My apologies. ,36,4
Utena,Wow...this is kind of exciting. ,36,4
Utena,Just like when I went to the park at night.,36,4
Utena,To think you and I actually Dueled here...,36,4
Akio,True. ,36,4
Utena,There're so many stars. ,36,4
Utena,What? ,36,4
Touga,You're beautiful. ,36,4
Touga,How fortunate I am to have been able to meet you.,36,4
Utena,Here you go again. ,36,4
Utena,"Just forget about that stuff and get to the point, okay?",36,4
Touga,Do you love the Chairman? ,36,4
Utena,How...how could I? ,36,4
Utena,"He's got a fiancee, you know. ",36,4
Touga,I see. ,36,4
Utena,Why'd you ask me that. What about the Ends of the World?,36,4
Touga,"The Ends of the World, huh? ",36,4
Touga,I can't reveal his name now. You'll find out who he is soon enough.,36,4
Touga,"But before that, I wanted to talk to you.",36,4
Utena,What about? ,36,4
Touga,Is there no way I can be your Prince? ,36,4
Touga,You're my only princess. ,36,4
Utena,Not that again. ,36,4
Touga,It's true. I love you. ,36,4
Touga,"From my heart, I treasure you. ",36,4
Touga,Your nobility and beauty shine on many. ,36,4
Touga,"And even if I'm not worthy of you, please, be with me for at least this instant.",36,4
Touga,Just that will do. ,36,4
Touga,"If I can just carve the memory of this night, the two of us together, within me,",36,4
Touga,that will be enough. Will you permit me that much?,36,4
Utena,I understand. ,36,4
Touga,Thank you. ,36,4
Touga,Is there no way I can be your Prince? ,36,4
Utena,"Come to think of it, that's what I thought when we first met.",36,4
Utena,That the President might be my Prince. ,36,4
Saionji,"How'd it go? Did you get this ""answer"" you wanted?",36,4
Touga,Yeah. Last night made it perfectly clear.,36,4
Saionji,Oh? Then care to let me in on it? ,36,4
Touga,It's now clear that she's someone very important to me.,36,4
Saionji,So now what? ,36,4
Touga,I will fight once again! ,36,4
Touga,And I must prevail. ,36,4
Touga,"After all, there's no other way to save her.",36,4
Touga,"If she wins the next duel, ",36,4
Saionji,she gets the Power to Revolutionize the World.,36,4
Saionji,But if that happens... ,36,4
Touga,...she'll fall into the Ends of the World's hands.,36,4
Saionji,"So, shall we? ",36,4
Anthy,Utena-sama. ,36,4
Utena,Hm? ,36,4
Anthy,Where were you last night? ,36,4
Utena,"Oh, um, I had stuff to do. ",36,4
Touga,Hi. May we join you? ,36,4
Utena,What did you say? ,36,4
Touga,Let me repeat myself. I want to Duel with you again.,36,4
Utena,What're you thinking? ,36,4
Touga,"You intend to protect the Rose Bride, correct?",36,4
Utena,That's right. I won't let anybody lay a finger on her.,36,4
Touga,"Then I promise you this. If you win, none of the Student Council will ever target her again.",36,4
Touga,"But if I win, you become my woman. ",36,4
Utena,I misjudged you. I can't believe you'd say such a thing...,36,4
Touga,No objections? ,36,4
Utena,No. ,36,4
Shadow,"Gallop gallop gallop. Lo, give ear to the sound if ye be afar!",36,4
Shadow,And behold if ye be close at hand! ,36,4
Shadow,For I be a Prince upon a white horse! ,36,4

Shadow,"This flowing mane, these splendid forelegs...how magnificent!",36,4
Shadow,"See here, that's not the Prince of white horses, that's the white horse of the Prince.",36,4
Shadow,The Prince is me. ,36,4
Shadow,"But, does that mean you're not a human Prince?",36,4
Shadow,"I'm human, but I'm called a ""Prince upon a white horse.""",36,4
Shadow,"Well anyway, you're a Prince too right? How wonderful!",36,4
Shadow,Do you really want a horse Prince? ,36,4
Shadow,Of horse! ,36,4
Touga,This fight will determine the one who shall Revolutionize the World.,36,4
Utena,"Who cares about that. Anways, your promise not to touch Anthy if I win is for real, right?",36,4

Utena,Himemiya! Himemiya!! ,36,4

Utena,Let's go. Akio-san is waiting. ,36,4
Touga,Hold it. You've now become the one who will Revolutionize the World.,36,4
Touga,"But you mustn't open your heart to the Ends of the World, or to the Rose Bride.",36,4
Touga,That's the last thing I can say. ,36,4
Utena,"Not that again...farewell, senpai. ",36,4
Saionji,Touga. ,36,4
Touga,Yeah. ,36,4
Saionji,Is it over for us? ,36,4
Touga,No. It's not over until we see it through the very end.,36,4
Anthy,I bet you're tired from today. ,36,4
Anthy,Please get a good night's sleep. ,36,4
Utena,Yeah. Isn't this great? Now there's nobody left who'll target you.,36,4
Anthy,Yes. ,36,4
Utena,Akio-san... ,36,4
Utena,"Oh, shoot. I gotta get in bed the right way.",36,4
Utena,Himemiya? ,36,4
Utena,"Ah, there she is. ",36,4
Utena,I'll become a Prince no matter what!,37,4
Dios,"If you can retain that nobility even when you grow up,",37,4
Dios,That ring... ,37,4
Utena,That ring...will surely lead you to me again.,37,4
text,The One Who Will Revolutionize the World ,37,4
Akio,Didn't you sleep well? ,37,4
Utena,Huh? ,37,4
Akio,You've got that look. Is something bothering you?,37,4
Utena,"Yeah, sort of. But it's not the sort of thing I can talk over with others.",37,4
Utena,"Everyone has things they can't say to others, don't they?",37,4
Akio,Yes. ,37,4
Akio,"Come to think of it, you're not wearing it today.",37,4
Akio,Your ring. ,37,4
Utena,If...you've got time... ,37,4
Utena,If you've got time after school today...could you come with me?,37,4
Anthy,I'm sorry. ,37,4
Anthy,"This was yours and not mine, wasn't it?",37,4
Akio,"You're inviting me on a date, aren't you?",37,4
Utena,Of course. ,37,4
Akio,Then I'll be waiting in front of the house at 5 o'clock.,37,4
Utena,"Wow, being able to go on a date with a cool guy like you is every girl's dream!",37,4
Anthy,*whistle* ,37,4
Touga,Did you get one? ,37,4
Saionji,Yeah. I just got a letter from the Ends of the World.,37,4
Saionji,A farewell letter. ,37,4
Touga,I bet she got a letter too by now. ,37,4
Touga,A different letter from ours. ,37,4
Touga,But she isn't interested in the Revolution. ,37,4
Saionji,Then will Dios's power stay sealed and the Revolution just not happen?,37,4
Touga,I don't know. Even I don't know the Ends of the World's true objective.,37,4
Saionji,"By the way, does Tenjou Utena know who the Ends of the World really is?",37,4
Touga,"Man, it's been a while since you and I rode bike together.",37,4
Saionji,Yeah. I wonder how long... ,37,4
Anthy,*whistle* ,37,4
Utena,That was fun. Thanks for today. ,37,4
Akio,"You really aren't wearing your ring, are you?",37,4
Akio,Why? ,37,4
Utena,I was thinking it maybe didn't suit me.,37,4
Akio,Your clothing suits you quite well. ,37,4
Akio,Shall I give you a ring that suits your clothing better?,37,4
Utena,I wonder if Himemiya's asleep already. ,37,4
Akio,"Tonight, you... ",37,4
Utena,What is it? ,37,4
Akio,"Tonight, you somehow seem very feminine. ",37,4
Utena,"Well, I am a girl. ",37,4
Akio,True. ,37,4
Utena,The Big Dipper. ,37,4
Utena,"Come to think of it, you're not talking about the stars today.",37,4
Akio,Shall I tell you the truth? ,37,4
Akio,"Actually, I have no interest whatsoever in the stars.",37,4
Anthy,"Welcome back, Utena-sama. ",37,4
Utena,"Oh, you're still awake. ",37,4
Utena,Are you upset? ,37,4
Anthy,What about? ,37,4
Utena,I thought you'd say that. ,37,4
Utena,Maybe I picked on you a little. ,37,4
Utena,I seem really feminine tonight. Akio-san said that.,37,4
Utena,What does it mean to be feminine? ,37,4
Anthy,Girls...girls are all like the Bride of the Rose in the end.,37,4
Anthy,Did you get the letter from the Ends of the World?,37,4
Utena,Yeah. ,37,4
Anthy,"If you go to that castle, you'll meet your Prince.",37,4
Utena,"A lot has happened since I met you, hasn't it?",37,4
Utena,Really...so many things. ,37,4
Touga,"But, is this goodbye? ",37,4
Saionji,"Sending a letter to say goodbye is ""you"" down to the last drop.",37,4
Touga,So what do you intend to do with her? ,37,4
Akio,"What do you mean, what do I intend? ",37,4
Touga,I can't imagine that Tenjou Utena would go through the Rose Gate.,37,4
Saionji,She has no reason to. ,37,4
Akio,Really? ,37,4
Touga,She didn't want to become the one to Revolutionize the World.,37,4
Touga,But you have her heart now. ,37,4
Touga,"She chose you, a real person, over her Prince.",37,4
Akio,The choice is hers. And she hasn't chosen yet.,37,4
Anthy,It seems my brother loves you too. ,37,4
Anthy,"Utena-sama, ",37,4
Anthy,I hope we can be together like this forever.,37,4
Utena,Senpai...Micky... ,37,4
Utena,I don't see the two of you together very often.,37,4
Utena,Is this another Duel challenge? ,37,4
Miki,We received letters from the Ends of the World.,37,4
Juri,They said you had been chosen as the one to Revolutionize the World.,37,4
Utena,And? ,37,4
Miki,And we wanted to know what you intend to do.,37,4
Utena,"The Power to Revolutionize the World, huh? Sounds pretty cool.",37,4
Utena,But all I'm doing is just pretending to be a Prince.,37,4
Juri,"In the end, none of us could beat you. ",37,4
Miki,Oops! ,37,4
Juri,"Thinking back, despite being a member of the Student Council, I was thinking only of myself.",37,4
Juri,"And it's pathetic, but I've got my hands full with my own problems even now.",37,4
Utena,Are you talking about Shiori-san? ,37,4
Juri,Why is it? ,37,4
Juri,Why can't I have any control over my own feelings?,37,4
Juri,What will you do about Anthy? ,37,4
Utena,What? ,37,4
Juri,"You love her, right? ",37,4
Utena,"Well...it's not like your ""love"". ",37,4
Utena,"Mine is pure, and...well, I guess yours is pure too, but...",37,4
Utena,But I can't...Himemiya... ,37,4
Utena,any longer... ,37,4
Utena,Nanami. ,37,4
Nanami,Are you stupid or something? ,37,4
Nanami,Haven't you figured out you're being suckered yet?,37,4
Juri,"Well, that's an outfit we haven't seen in a while.",37,4
Miki,Does that mean you're quitting the Student Council?,37,4
Nanami,Hell yes. I couldn't stand doing that any longer. What a laugh.,37,4
Nanami,And you'd better quit hanging out with the Chairman and Himemiya Anthy if you know what's good foryou.,37,4
Utena,Thanks for the warning. ,37,4
Nanami,I'm serious! You're too big of a busibody! ,37,4
Nanami,You idiot! ,37,4
Utena,Doesn't warning me qualify you as a busibody too?,37,4
Nanami,I forget myself when I talk to you. ,37,4
Utena,"Well, I'm a type-B who really gets stuck on things.",37,4
Nanami,Me too. ,37,4
Miki,"Hey, Tenjou-senpai. ",37,4
Utena,What? ,37,4
Miki,I've been really worried about you lately. ,37,4
Juri,"Well well, is that a confession? ",37,4
Utena,"Miki loves Himemiya, right? ",37,4
Miki,Can't I switch over to you? ,37,4
Utena,I'll think about it. ,37,4
Juri,Could I have a picture of you too? ,37,4
Utena,What for? ,37,4
Juri,I was thinking of putting in the new pendant I just bought.,37,4
Miki,"Oh man, a strong rival just appeared. ",37,4
Nanami,"What are you, idiots? ",37,4
sign,Shadows Gathering Kashira Theater ,37,4

Shadow,I saw this application on your desk. You're going to take it right?,37,4

Anthy,The future? ,37,4
Utena,After you graduate and leave here. Do you have anything you want to do?,37,4
Anthy,I can't do anything besides raise roses... ,37,4
Utena,Then how about you become a florist. ,37,4
Anthy,That sounds good. ,37,4
Anthy,"Say, Utena-sama. Have you heard of Cantarella?",37,4
Utena,"""Cantarella""? What's that? ",37,4
Anthy,It's the name of a deadly poison that the Italian Borgia family used in the past.,37,4
Utena,Really... ,37,4
Anthy,How do you like those cookies? I baked them.,37,4
Utena,What a coincidence. ,37,4
Utena,That tea is poisoned too. ,37,4
Anthy,Really? ,37,4
Anthy,It's quite delicious. ,37,4
Utena,So are these cookies. ,37,4
Anthy,Utena-sama. ,37,4
Utena,Hmm? ,37,4
Anthy,What will you be doing in ten years? ,37,4
Utena,I dunno. But... ,37,4
Anthy,But? ,37,4
Utena,But I hope we can be together like this drinking tea then.,37,4
Anthy,Yes. I hope so too. ,37,4
Utena,I'm sure that'll be great. ,37,4
Utena,"Let's have tea and laugh together ten years from now, okay?",37,4
Utena,Promise? ,37,4
Anthy,Yes. Definitely. ,37,4
Utena,Are you running away? ,37,4
Anthy,I can't take any more! I'm sorry! ,37,4
Anthy,Don't worry about me anymore! ,37,4
Utena,Are you running away?! ,37,4
Utena,Weren't we gonna have tea and laugh together for our ten-year reunion?,37,4
Anthy,"I'm sorry, Utena-sama. ",37,4
Anthy,I'm so sorry. ,37,4
Touga,I didn't think you'd go. ,37,4
Touga,Do you want to meet your Prince that badly?,37,4
Utena,That's not all. ,37,4
Saionji,"Then, for what? ",37,4
Touga,Is it for Himemiya? ,37,4
Touga,He who believes friendship exists is a fool.,37,4
Utena,Didn't you know? I am a fool. ,37,4
Anthy,"""The time is ripe. The time to pass through the Rose Gate,",37,4
Anthy,"when the path to the Castle is opened, ",37,4
Anthy,and you shall receive the Power to Revolutionize the World.,37,4
Anthy,"And there, we shall meet again. ",37,4
Anthy,"From your Prince."" ",37,4
Anthy,Utena-sama. You can still turn back. ,37,4
Utena,Let's go. ,37,4
title,"""The Ends of the World""",38,4
Utena,Where are we? ,38,4
Utena,The Prince... ,38,4
Akio,Yes. The Prince. ,38,4
Utena,"So, you were the Ends of the World after all, huh?",38,4
Utena,You're the one who was behind everything. ,38,4
Akio,You knew all along. ,38,4
Akio,"But, I'm your Prince. You came all this way to meet me.",38,4
Utena,I want to know your reason. ,38,4
Akio,Reason? ,38,4
Utena,The reason behind making everybody Duel!,38,4
Utena,What is the meaning of all the things being done at this school?,38,4
Akio,How courageous. ,38,4
Akio,What sort of dreams have you been dreaming lately?,38,4
Akio,I always dream of the castle. ,38,4
Utena,The castle? ,38,4
Akio,Yes. The castle where the Prince and the princess will live...,38,4
Akio,...happily for ever and ever and ever after.,38,4
Akio,The Prince is me. And the princess is you.,38,4
Utena,Himemiya! ,38,4
Akio,You needn't be alarmed. Anthy is right over there.,38,4
Akio,That ring would have lead you here sooner or later.,38,4
Akio,"You truly have done well, coming all this distance without losing your noble heart.",38,4
Akio,My judgement was sound. ,38,4
Akio,You're beautiful. ,38,4
Akio,Bearing your noble heart all the way here...,38,4
Akio,You are my true princess. ,38,4
Akio,Swords no longer suit you. ,38,4
Akio,"I shall keep this sword. And from this day forward, I will protect you.",38,4
Utena,And what happens then? ,38,4
Akio,You'll be happy. You'll receive eternity and we will love each other forever.,38,4
Akio,And the princess will live forever and ever with the Prince in the castle.,38,4
Akio,What's wrong? ,38,4
Utena,"If we live happily in the castle, what'll happen to Himemiya?",38,4
Akio,She'll remain the Rose Bride. Forever. ,38,4
Utena,Are you running away? ,38,4
Anthy,Don't worry about me anymore! ,38,4
Utena,Are you running away?! ,38,4
Utena,Weren't we gonna have tea and laugh together for our ten-year reunion?,38,4
Anthy,"I'm sorry, Utena-sama. ",38,4
Anthy,I'm so sorry. ,38,4
Anthy,Because I'm the Rose Bride...because I'm a doll with no heart...,38,4
Anthy,"I thought that no matter what befell my body, my heart wouldn't feel the pain.",38,4
Anthy,"I'm sorry, Utena-sama. My suffering is my rightful punishment as the Rose Bride.",38,4
Anthy,But...making you suffer...you were merely caught up in it all...,38,4
Anthy,I knew everything. ,38,4
Anthy,I exploited your innocence. I encroached upon your kindness.,38,4
Anthy,"I'm sorry, Utena-sama. I've been unfair to you.",38,4
Anthy,I'm a dirty woman. I've betrayed you all along. I-,38,4
Utena,No. ,38,4
Utena,I...didn't recognize your pain. ,38,4
Utena,I didn't realize your suffering. ,38,4
Utena,"Instead, I just kept on pretending to be the Prince who could save you.",38,4
Utena,I was just being conceited about protecting you.,38,4
Utena,And when I saw you and Akio-san together...I even thought you had betrayed me.,38,4
Utena,When you were suffering so much...when I had said we should save each other...,38,4
Utena,I'M the one who's unfair. I'm the one who's dirty.,38,4
Utena,I'm the one who betrayed you. ,38,4
Anthy,"It's okay now, so please...leave this school.",38,4
Anthy,Please forget about all of this. ,38,4
Utena,How...the hell could I do that? ,38,4
Utena,That's right. There's no way in hell I can do that.,38,4
Akio,What're you doing? ,38,4
Akio,A sword isn't meant for a girl to wave around like that.,38,4
Utena,I'll free Himemiya from you! ,38,4
Akio,Truly courageous. ,38,4
Akio,Who would have thought it would come to this?,38,4
Utena,What're you talking about? ,38,4
Akio,"But, just as I once said, now that time has passed...",38,4
Akio,...you should no longer be just a pure soul who wants to be a Prince.,38,4
Akio,Dresses don't go with swords. ,38,4
Akio,Looking at you reminds me of my former self.,38,4
Akio,"But, that's exactly why you can't save her.",38,4
Akio,"In the end, all that stuff about the Prince and the castle holding eternity is merely make-believe.",38,4
Akio,"Now, allow me to show you what's real. ",38,4
Utena,Real? ,38,4
Akio,The Ends of the World. ,38,4
Utena,This is... ,38,4
Utena,your room! ,38,4
Akio,"A magnificent Planetarium, isn't it? ",38,4
Akio,This device paints the illusion of fairy tales for those with naive wishes in their hearts...,38,4
Akio,"...who say they wish something eternal existed, who say they wish the power of miracles existed.",38,4
Akio,"But, there's no place higher than this room.",38,4
Akio,"This room is the summit of Ohtori Academy, and of the world.",38,4
Utena,I hate this room. ,38,4
Akio,Someone as young as you might not appreciate the value of this room.,38,4
Akio,"And so instead of the real Chairman's Room, you chase after phantom Castles in the sky.",38,4
Utena,That's not it. This is the room where you and Anthy always...,38,4
Akio,Always...? ,38,4
Akio,"Oh, is that what you're upset about?",38,4
Akio,Am I really doing something that despicable?,38,4
Akio,"And even if I am, you're the same as me.",38,4
Utena,What're you talking about? ,38,4
Akio,I doubt you've forgotten. ,38,4
Akio,"Behold, the memory of the two of us. ",38,4
Akio,"I have a fiancee, but that didn't stop you.",38,4
Akio,Isn't that a sin? ,38,4
Utena,That's not fair. ,38,4
Akio,Unfair? Isn't it unfair to turn your eyes from the truth and then criticize others?,38,4
Akio,Isn't it UNFAIR to pretend that your conscience is clear and that YOU'RE the one in the right?,38,4
Utena,That's not it! I...Himemiya... ,38,4
Akio,That's right. You didn't even try to understand Anthy.,38,4
Akio,"In the end, you had your hands full just thinking about yourself.",38,4
Akio,How cute. You're a good woman. ,38,4
Akio,You should stay a girl. ,38,4
Akio,"There was a time when you were helpless and reality subjugated you,",38,4
Akio,no matter how much you struggled. ,38,4
Akio,"With no way to escape the cruel reality before your eyes,",38,4
Akio,you tried to segregate yourself from the world.,38,4
Akio,The one who saved you from within that darkness...was me.,38,4
Akio,I'm the one who gave you the power to face the world again.,38,4
Akio,"At that time, I was a Prince to you. ",38,4
Akio,"But, I'm the same, then and now. ",38,4
Akio,"And Anthy was the Rose Bride, then and now.",38,4
Akio,And she's a witch. ,38,4
Akio,"That goes for you too. Both then and now, you're a girl.",38,4
Akio,There's no need for you to fight with a sword in your hand.,38,4
Akio,"You can become a noble, beautiful princess. ",38,4
Akio,"Now, won't you give me that sword? ",38,4
Utena,What do you plan to do with this sword? ,38,4
Akio,I'll Revolutionize the World. ,38,4
Utena,Aren't you her brother?! ,38,4
Utena,Are you just going to abandon her? ,38,4
Akio,Foolish lifeform. ,38,4
Akio,There never was any such thing as a Prince anywhere in the world in the first place.,38,4
Utena,Didn't you just say you were a Prince? ,38,4
Akio,Do you know what that is? ,38,4
Akio,"It's Dios's, the Prince's Grave. ",38,4
Akio,"When she became known as a witch, Dios perished.",38,4
Akio,The Princely me no longer exists. ,38,4
Utena,I guess I have no choice but to fight with you.,38,4
Akio,For Anthy? ,38,4
Akio,"I thought that she was a goddess who sacrificed her body for the one she loved, for me.",38,4
Akio,I once thought so too. ,38,4
Akio,"And she really might have been, once. But now she's a witch.",38,4
Akio,And she enjoys being a witch. ,38,4
Utena,You're the one who's making her a witch! ,38,4
Akio,Wrong. We love each other. She can't be happy any other way.,38,4
Touga,"If it does not break the egg's shell, ",38,4
Touga,the chick will die without being born. ,38,4
Miki,We are the chick. ,38,4
Juri,The egg is the world. ,38,4
Nanami,"If we do not break the shell of the world,",38,4
Nanami,we will die without being born. ,38,4
Saionji,Break the shell of the world. ,38,4
Touga,To Revolutionize the World! ,38,4
Miki,To Revolutionize the World! ,38,4
Juri,To Revolutionize the World! ,38,4
Nanami,To Revolutionize the World! ,38,4
Saionji,To Revolutionize the World! ,38,4
Miki,"It's begun, hasn't it. ",38,4
Juri,Yeah. ,38,4
Nanami,Tenjou Utena. ,38,4
Saionji,That's right. ,38,4
Nanami,"So, what happens to the Victor of this game?",38,4
Touga,Nobody knows. But it will be her final trial.,38,4
Touga,The Duel Called Revolution has now begun.,38,4
Akio,I'm not a Duelist. ,38,4
Akio,Fighting me isn't some play duel. ,38,4
Utena,I was never playing when I dueled! ,38,4
Akio,"No, you know nothing besides play duels. ",38,4
Akio,"But if you don't put up your sword now, you'll find out how terrifying real duels are.",38,4
Utena,I won't let you beat me. ,38,4
Akio,A child like you can't appreciate my ideals.,38,4
Akio,The Rose Bride exists because of ideals you don't comprehend.,38,4
Utena,What kind of shitty ideal makes you use this room to control everybody's lives?!,38,4
Akio,A child wouldn't appreciate the value of this room.,38,4
Utena,What is the value of this room?! ,38,4
Utena,Making Himemiya suffer more?! ,38,4
Akio,She's the Rose Bride of her own free will.,38,4
Akio,There's no call for you to interfere. ,38,4
Anthy,"I am the Rose Bride...from today forward, I am your flower.",38,4
Anthy,"Really, I... ",38,4
Anthy,"I'm sorry, Utena-sama. ",38,4
Anthy,I'm so sorry. ,38,4
Utena,I'll be the one to free her from you! ,38,4
Akio,Do you know what you're saying? ,38,4
Utena,Sure I do! It means I'll become a Prince! ,38,4
Utena,Why...? ,38,4
Utena,Himemiya...why... ,38,4
Utena,Why...,39,4
Utena,Why... ,39,4
Anthy,You remind me of the Dios I once loved. ,39,4
Anthy,But you can't become my Prince. ,39,4
Anthy,Because you're a girl. ,39,4
Utena,Hime...Himemiya... ,39,4
Akio,I told you this wasn't a game. ,39,4
Saionji,The Duel Called Revolution...huh? ,39,4
Touga,Don't remove that yet. ,39,4
Touga,"As the representative of all us Duelists, she's entered the Duel Arena.",39,4
Touga,"Until all is decided, we all must remain Duelists.",39,4
Nanami,I already took mine off. ,39,4
Nanami,We should all just hurry up and forget all this.,39,4
Miki,I wonder if this is the sort of thing that can be forgotten.,39,4
Juri,Come to think of it...I've forgotten that boy's name.,39,4
Miki,"""That boy""? ",39,4
Juri,"Long ago, when my older sister was still a child, she nearly drowned in a river.",39,4
Juri,"On that day, there was a boy who jumped into the river to try to save her.",39,4
Nanami,And? ,39,4
Juri,"My sister got lucky and was saved by a nearby adult, but...",39,4
Juri,the boy who tried to save my sister and jumped into the river was swept away.,39,4
Nanami,Did he die? ,39,4
Juri,I thought my sister was very cold for forgetting his name so quickly...,39,4
Juri,"But now that I try to remember, it seems I've forgotten it too.",39,4
Nanami,Hey... ,39,4
Nanami,Hey... ,39,4
Nanami,Why'd you tell us that now? ,39,4
Akio,"Anthy, the sword. ",39,4
Akio,What is it? What're you waiting for? ,39,4
Anthy,I... ,39,4
Akio,Are you regretting what you've done? ,39,4
Akio,We had to subject your friend to misfortune after all.,39,4
Akio,Yes. It's all my fault. Do you hate me now?,39,4
Akio,"Maybe if I tried to be a Prince like in the old days, noone would have had to suffer.",39,4
Akio,"I always feel your wounds, your suffering, with my own body.",39,4
Anthy,"You are he who chose this road, knowing the whole of the world.",39,4
Akio,"Knowing the whole of you, I love you. ",39,4
Anthy,"Yes, brother. ",39,4
Akio,"Anthy, the sword. ",39,4
Akio,"That's right. You're a good girl, Anthy. ",39,4
Akio,The Rose Gate. The doorway which seals the Power to Revolutionize the World.,39,4
Akio,They've come. ,39,4
Akio,Anthy! ,39,4
Utena,Hime...miya...you mustn't...Hi...me... ,39,4
Anthy,"My meddlesome hero. Thanks for a small taste of what you call ""friendship"".",39,4
Anthy,Farewell. ,39,4
Utena,You...mustn't...Hime...miya...Hime... ,39,4
Akio,The Million Swords that shine with people's hatred.,39,4
Akio,They stir at the sight of this Prince's sword.,39,4
swords,The witch...the witch...the witch...witch...accursed witch...witch...,39,4
Utena,Himemiya....Himemiya! ,39,4
Akio,Drawing the swords from the Prince to herself.,39,4
Akio,That is the Rose Bride's destiny. ,39,4
Akio,Anthy wished for it all herself. ,39,4
Utena,Himemiya. Himemiya! ,39,4
Utena,Himemiya...Himemiya! ,39,4
Utena,HIMEMIYA!! ,39,4
Akio,The time has come to break the seal. ,39,4
Akio,The time has come to open the door to a new world.,39,4
Utena,Akio-san...save Himemiya. ,39,4
Utena,Akio-san! ,39,4
Utena,Hey...save her... ,39,4
Utena,Save...Himemiya... ,39,4
Dios,You should't move. I'll tend to your wounds later.,39,4
Dios,Such a gentle child. Are you crying? ,39,4
Dios,Do you see the rose-shaped gate over there?,39,4
Dios,"Within that gate is that which is eternal, something shining, the power of miracles.",39,4
Dios,"With that power, anything is possible. ",39,4
Dios,"You can't do it. You're a girl, aren't you?",39,4
Dios,"Besides, you don't have power. With power, anything is possible.",39,4
Dios,You can even free her from her fate. ,39,4
Dios,But how the power is used... ,39,4
Akio,...is my decision. ,39,4
Dios,Don't look so miserable. ,39,4
Dios,"You've tried so hard until now, you needn't blame yourself.",39,4
Dios,You've treasured your Rose Signet until now.,39,4
Dios,I shall give you a kiss as your reward. ,39,4
Dios,This is your consolation. ,39,4
Akio,"Once again, even this sword fails? ",39,4
Akio,"Tell me, when will I ever recover the Power of Dios?",39,4
Akio,"Well, no matter. The Rose Bride is mine. ",39,4
Akio,I can always- ,39,4
Akio,I'm amazed you managed to stand up. ,39,4
Akio,Don't tell me you seriously intend to open this gate?,39,4
Akio,Don't bother. The Prince's sword is already broken.,39,4
Akio,The seal can no longer... ,39,4
Akio,The seal can't be broken. It's impossible for you.,39,4
Akio,I defeated you and... ,39,4
Akio,Very well. ,39,4
Akio,Suit yourself. ,39,4
Utena,Himemiya! ,39,4
Utena,Himemiya!! ,39,4
Akio,She certainly resembles the old me. ,39,4
Akio,I used to be like that. ,39,4
Akio,I used to think that sincerity was valuable... ,39,4
Akio,...and that it was the one and only way to change the world.,39,4
Akio,But sincerity by itself changes nothing. ,39,4
Akio,"Without power, one finds themself merely depending on others to live.",39,4
Akio,I've taken enough risks to buy the power to change the world.,39,4
Akio,That's how the world works- ,39,4
Utena,Shut up!! ,39,4
Utena,Himemiya...you don't know... ,39,4
Utena,...how happy I was...just being together with you...,39,4
Akio,Wh...what the?! ,39,4
Akio,The swords! ,39,4
Akio,That's the... ,39,4
Akio,STOP IT!! ,39,4
Akio,Don't open that! You don't know what'll happen!,39,4
Akio,STOP!! ,39,4
Akio,Stop... ,39,4
Utena,Himemiya...Himemiya... ,39,4
Anthy,Who are you? ,39,4
Utena,I came to save you. ,39,4
Anthy,"But, you're a... ",39,4
Utena,I came here to meet you. ,39,4
Utena,So don't be afraid of this world where we'll meet.,39,4
Utena,...Himemiya...Himemiya...Himemiya! ,39,4
Utena,Himemiya! ,39,4
Anthy,Utena...sama...? ,39,4
Utena,Himemiya...we finally...meet. ,39,4
Anthy,Utena-sama! ,39,4
Anthy,Utena-sama! ,39,4
Utena,Himemiya...take my hand! ,39,4
Anthy,You mustn't! Hurry and run away! The swords are...,39,4
Utena,"Take my hand! Come on, Himemiya! ",39,4
Anthy,You don't understand! If you don't run quickly...,39,4
Utena,"Himemiya! Hurry, take my hand! ",39,4
Anthy,I beg you. ,39,4
Utena,Hurry! Hurry up and take my hand! ,39,4
Utena,"Someday...someday, the two of us... ",39,4
Utena,I really...couldn't become a Prince. ,39,4
Utena,"I'm sorry, Himemiya. Sorry for ending up just a make-believe Prince...",39,4
Utena,Forgive me. ,39,4
Wakaba,I guess Utena's not here. And here I wanted to do homework together.,39,4
Shadow,What're you gonna do when you graduate? ,39,4
Shadow,"I'm going to high school, of course. ",39,4
Shadow,"No, I mean in your future. ",39,4
Shadow,Haven't decided yet. ,39,4
Shadow,I wanna be an actress. ,39,4
Shadow,Do you really believe you can pull that off?,39,4
Shadow,"Man, you're dead serious about becoming one.",39,4
Shadow,"Well, look forward to our ten year reunion.",39,4
Shadow,Hey... ,39,4
Shadow,And what about you? ,39,4
Shadow,What about? ,39,4
Shadow,Your future. ,39,4
Shadow,I guess I'll get married to some high-ranking man.,39,4
Shadow,There she goes. ,39,4
Shadow,There she goes. ,39,4
Shadow,"Hey, aren't women supposed to be good at nabbing handsome guys?",39,4
Shadow,Get a load of this! ,39,4
Shadow,This little tramp just started going out with the man of her dreams.,39,4
Shadow,"She's the one who kept going ""Utena-sama, Utena-sama"" all the time.",39,4
Shadow,"Hey, you got a problem with that? ",39,4
Shadow,"Hey, who was Utena-sama again? ",39,4
Shadow,"What, don't you know? ",39,4
Shadow,Remember? She's that girl who always dressed like a guy.,39,4
Shadow,She got hassled by the teachers all the time.,39,4
Shadow,"Oh, now I remember. Her! ",39,4
Shadow,But didn't she get hurt real bad and hospitalized a month or two ago?,39,4
Shadow,Huh? Hospitalized? I heard she got betrayed by a friend or a lover or something and switched schools.,39,4
Shadow,I heard she got in trouble with the Chairman of the Board of Trustees and expelled.,39,4
Shadow,"Well, not like it matters. ",39,4
Kozue,"That's the timing, got it? ",39,4
Tsuwabuki,Yes! ,39,4
Miki,You'll assist me with my job from next term on.,39,4
Touga,I hear you're taking more classes in your major lately.,39,4
Saionji,I wanted to get back the stuff I'd lost when I was playing.,39,4
Touga,"Playing, huh? ",39,4
Nanami,Tea's ready. ,39,4
Saionji,Thanks. ,39,4
Touga,We'll be right there. ,39,4
Juri,Next! ,39,4
Shiori,Yes! ,39,4
Wakaba,Such nice weather. ,39,4
girl,Wa-ka-ba! ,39,4
girl,"You got me, your bestest friend in the whole world a birthday present, right?!",39,4
Akio,"It hasn't been that long since then, but everybody's forgotten about her completely.",39,4
Akio,She didn't cause a Revolution after all.,39,4
Akio,"Now that she's gone, she was just a dropout to this world.",39,4
Akio,I've got to rebuild the Code of the Rose Signet from scratch.,39,4
Akio,"I'm counting on you, Anthy. ",39,4
Anthy,"You don't know what happened, do you? ",39,4
Akio,What? ,39,4
Anthy,"It's alright now. Please go on playing make-believe ""Prince"" in this comfortable little coffin forever.",39,4
Anthy,But I must go. ,39,4
Akio,Go? To where? ,39,4
Anthy,That person hasn't vanished. She's merely left your world.,39,4
Akio,What're you talking about? ,39,4
Akio,W-wait a minute! Anthy! ,39,4
Akio,Anthy!! ,39,4
Anthy,Farewell. ,39,4
Anthy,Now it's my turn to go to you. ,39,4
Anthy,"No matter where you are, I'll find you for sure.",39,4
Anthy,"Wait for me, Utena. ",39,4
Utena,"Hey, if anything is troubling you, tell me about it.",39,4
Utena,I want to be your friend. ,39,4
Utena,"And someday, with me... ",39,4
Anthy,"Someday, with you? ",39,4
